	 <string id="bm_msl_sds_06_desc">There it is, your unquenchable need to stuff your face and fill your belly with the ravaging furor of someone in a constant state of starvation. And when you stop, it&apos;s like a gaping hole opens up in the pit of your stomache, craving to be satiated.</string>

	 <string id="bm_paycheck_dallas_desc">Paycheck Dallas finally made the decision to stop using black plastic bags for concealment. He gathered the nerve to order a real Dallas-mask to honor his idol, but that online printing service didn&apos;t exactly deliver the real deal... Even so, with the mask, he&apos;s trying to step up his game and convinced the Paycheck gang to raid a china shop. The CCTV footage shows that Paycheck Dallas accidentally broke the biggest vase while storming in. That made him apologize to the owner, grab all small changes from register and run for the door.  Probably blushing like a tomato behind that smiling neon mask.</string>
	 <string id="bm_sfm_03_desc">The day Chad got the Barrori Flex sunglasses, everything changed.They gave him a brand new perspective on what&apos;s important in life. Looking cool and blase became his purpose, his reason to live. With his Italian sports coat, beige linen pants and loafers he caught jealous looks and turned necks wherever he went. But it couldn&apos;t last and when Chad&apos;s beauty faded so did his will to live. He made a good-looking corpse, best clothes on, when he swallowed a whole can of diet pills.</string>

	 <string id="bm_suit_punk_desc">The punk rock jacket and pants are a suit of armor, worn with pride in defiance of the established norms of &quot;polite&quot; society. A true punk jacket has every stud added laboriously by hand, and every painted decoration, also added by hand, has a deeper meaning for the individual wearer. Unless it&apos;s just a big fuck-you to the world at large, of course.</string>

	 <string id="bm_suit_var_desperado_red_desc">The gunslinger dropped to the ground, his last breath blowing up sand from the cracked, dry ground. Nearby, a scorpion watched him expire with indifference. As the buzzards began to circle above, a shadow fell over the body, an unknown figure bending down over it. A weathered, leathery hand reached down and picked up the gunslinger&apos; pistol. Cold, blue eyes inspected the worn gunmetal steel. Satisfied, the figure which the eyes belonged to got up, and walked away, disappearing over the horizon.</string>

	 <string id="bm_suit_var_hippie_abstraction_desc">In the late 1960s, a man was born. This man would have a life full of chaos, betrayal and trouble until he met the one who would become his mentor. The mentor taught him things, told him how the world really worked. He spoke of a book, known only to a few, that would reveal secrets untold. The man took this information and reformed his life. Eventually becoming one of the greatest criminal masterminds of all time, he would get back at all those who had wronged him, and undertake the greatest heist the public would never know of...</string>
	 <string id="bm_suit_var_jumpsuit_red_desc">So, what&apos;s the deal with heisters taking their nicknames from cities around the world? Coincidence? Are they lazy? Do they lack imagination? Or is there something larger afoot, all part of some unknown grand plan, hatched by Bain back in the day. And what&apos;s next, a heister named after Lubbock, Texas? Or maybe Tokyo? Feels like overkill, doesn&apos;t it? How far can the trend go? And will it continue in Chapter 3? Those who live to tell may learn the answer.</string>
	 <string id="bm_suit_var_miami_black_desc">Heisters don&apos;t cry, and very few of them wear mascara, but it stands to reason that just about anyone has, at one time or another, reveled in their secret inner Goth. Or maybe not. Maybe they just don&apos;t want to have to color-coordinate.</string>
	 <string id="bm_suit_var_miami_default_desc">One time, Sangres was escorting a shipment of stolen weapons by plane between Brazil and Mexico when his partner, who was wearing this suit, turned on him mid-flight. After a brief struggle, Sangres kicked him out of the cargo bay door. As his (now ex-) partner fell screaming, arms flailing wildly, Sangres couldn&apos;t help but notice how the blue of the suit was great camouflage against the bright blue sky. Then he went &quot;splat&quot; on the ground, and the look was ruined.</string>
	 <string id="bm_suit_var_peacoat_black_desc">A famous bounty hunter once wore a jacket like this every single day for ten years. For many years this person hounded Bain, long before Crimenet was created. Ultimately, when said bounty hunter&apos;s luck ran out and he was taken down by Bain, he kept the jacket as a trophy.</string>
	 <string id="bm_suit_var_peacoat_default_desc">Long ago, a dark shadow crept through the criminal underworld, killing the vilest mobsters in serial acts of untold violence. Fear engulfed the crime lords of America- no one knew when vengeance would come for them. A very small number of individuals managed to catch a glimpse of this roaming terror, yet could not say if it was one demon or many. The only description to come was of the suit that death wore- it was just like this one.</string>
	 <string id="bm_suit_var_peacoat_white_desc">The mob boss walked into the restaurant with his family, ready to sit down for a nice meal following a week of ordering the bloody end to a rival gang. Little did he know that the sole survivor of that gang was waiting for him in the bathroom. Before the mob boss could take his coat off, the survivor put a bullet in his back, ending the feud forever.</string>
	 <string id="bm_suit_var_punk_billieboy_desc">Conformity. Conformity of the chicken-shit kind surrounds us all the time. Like a pile of bricks, it weighs on the mind of each individual, forcing complacency. Unless you&apos;re the type of person who can&apos;t help but give a Rebel Yell and shake your fist in the air. And a heister who walks into a bank wearing this, shows the world they ain&apos;t afraid of anything!</string>
	 <string id="bm_suit_var_punk_scottish_desc">Punk was once the bane of morally panicking parents and the savior of many a derelict warehouse as a makeshift concert venue. On one particular evening in the 1980s, Dragan was in the London Docklands to meet a contact about a job, at the infamous &quot;Deadweek&quot; 7-day mohawk party. The contact never showed, and Dragan never heard from him again. To this day, he still doesn&apos;t know what happened.</string>

	 <string id="bm_suit_var_xmas_tuxedo_green_desc">Duke had downed one too many a brandy this holiday eve. His head swooned as he tried to reassemble the antique British revolver Hoxton had gifted him, as one of his cats sitting on a stool next to the table, watching intently. With a loud &apos;FOING&apos;, the trigger spring flew across the room,  with the cat dashing after it. Both disappeared into the branches of the safe house Christmas tree, making it topple. It fell over the top floor railing, landing with a loud crash down below, followed by an &quot;Aaargh!&quot; and a shout of &quot;The fuck is goin&apos; on up there?&quot;. A couple of minutes later, Chains came stomping up the stairs, Santa hat on his head, and hand over his face. He wasn&apos;t too happy. He removed his hand, revealing a big, swollen nose, as crimson as on a certain reindeer, as if it had been smashed by the trunk of the falling tree...</string>
