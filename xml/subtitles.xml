	 <string id="loc_jr1_45_01">I&apos;ve got some C4 for the job right here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_104_01">That&apos;s the keycard! Now, grab it and let&apos;s head back!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_06_03">Come on! Get him in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_68_03">No-one&apos;s seen you. Keep it that way. Now, the gate.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_21_02">That&apos;s the plane. Get the loot inside, then give it some fuel.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_100_01">The sewer entrance is near Jimbos, that auto chop shop. Keep your heads down. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_36_01">He is balding and wears a black suit. You probably scared him off, so look around the offices or in the corridors!</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_02_01">Two minutes. Learn to drive, asshole.</string>
	 <string id="alm_bex_02_01">Is this the right place? Mooooove!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_04d_02">Nice work! The fourth wave was beaten back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_72_02">Was that a vial breaking? Don&apos;t touch the blood!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_87_03">You gotta get the keycard in the Oval Office!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_86_02">Why don&apos;t I hear the sound of sawing coming through my headphones?</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_07_01">I count... two guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_13_03">Snipers again! Take &apos;em out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_140_03">OK, get ready, here I come!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_19_08">Did you really think you could capture me?</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_16_any_01">Fucking hell, you threw it in the water!?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_69_04">You need to stop that firewall.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_40_02">Argh, they pulled the power for the scanner!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_07_02">That&apos;s it, guys. The AA gun has been disabled. But there&apos;s still one more.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_40_03">Time to fly, friends. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_15">So hydrochloric acid was the same thing... huh, you learn something new every day.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_12_02">You&apos;re in, but the alarm was triggered. Lock it down before it goes off, and we can keep this caper on track.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_bag_03_01">The pick-up truck is here, you can throw the bags out the window if you wanna make a easy escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_41_any_01">A neighbor saw you. She called 911.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_07_any_09">I&apos;ll pack this into files and get ready to stream it up to the press.</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_04_01">Here come the cops! Come to fuck up Christmas. Hold them off, and make sure those elf bastards don&apos;t slacken off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_12_any_03">SWATs incoming from the lumber mill, keep them away!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_13_03">That was it. Niiice.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_118_01">The vault is protected by a laser gate, but no matter. You know what to do. Watch its sequence and time your run through.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_80_02">Now you got to find a way inside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_76_01">Keep the damn Murkies away from the weapon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_25_03">Put a gas can on the paintings, guys. Then shoot it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_08_03">Too much action here. I&apos;ll have the guys build the cage at the bridge.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_23_02">OK, now drive. Go, go, go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_37_03">C&apos;mon guys, get that liquid nitrogen.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_cnc_03">Dear friends, we&apos;re going to New York for a quick bank job. </string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_24_02">Hmm, the key must need a higher access level for the armory. You&apos;ll have to recode it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_105_03">Almost there!</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_03_03">Guys, safe to come out yet? I swallowed a cockroach.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_03_02">That&apos;s them! Now, get them back to Hoxton.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_02_05">Mitchell&apos;s by the pool. Introduce yourselves.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_11_03">Time is up, friends. You need to redo the hack.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_06_any_02">Chop chop. The feds will be here any moment.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_23_03b">Sweet baby Jesus protect me...</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_end_b_02">We got the address - problem is we did not get any intel. This means we are coming in hard and with no info on what to expect. Time is ticking - let&apos;s get up the mountains and steal this engine. </string>
	 <string id="geo_glc_02_01">Yeah, I&apos;m there in just a minute.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_58_04">You need to let the chem work on the door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_10_any_01">The wheelman had to run, too hot. He&apos;s relocating.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_29_01">Yeah, straight ahead there is your own private vault. We&apos;re gonna stack that up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_31_01">We&apos;re going to need that code. Rummage &apos;round a bit and see of you can find any clues. Maybe try one of the workstations? But stay quiet, friends. </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_69_02">There you go, the gun is primed and ready. Hit the fire button. And maybe don&apos;t look directly at it when it goes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_30_03">Same procedure as always.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_41_01">Guys, get that drill on the gate. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_03_01">You&apos;re looking for three cameras.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_43a_01">It&apos;s a shame you can&apos;t take those explosives and use them on Buluc. Make his head explode like in that Scanner movie! Oh, well. Make him suffer in some other way instead!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_101_03">The gas should be gone in a minute.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_02_01">Oooh, it&apos;s been a long time since Vlad did a good old-fashioned revenge taking. That piece of shit Buluc is going to wish he was born in Switzerland!$NL;</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_42_any_01">Loads of cash! Bag it up boys!</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_11_02">Yeah, well. Tell him his ass is on the line if he isn&apos;t available for the regular time-lock check in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_04_03">Ah, the weather could have been better for sure, but nevermind. Just get inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_06_02">The boxes are rigged with C4! Defuse them quick!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_23_01">Kepe piling &apos;em up. Make a nice bonfire.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_01_01">That card should get you entry to one of the train railcars.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_106_01">We already got the code. Enter it and get into the armory.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_58_any_01">I got to dash out in two minutes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_42_any_02">Sweet! That&apos;s the one. Fusion power in full swing. Thanks guys. Now get out of there. </string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_134_03">Finally! Now you just gotta go inside the vault.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_06_02">You see that bridge? I&apos;m dropping the cage over there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_53_01">Don&apos;t ask me where I got that thumb. Now verify identification from the security consoles. Shouldn&apos;t be a problem.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_08_02">Keeping my foot off the gas. Make sure you guys keep the road safe and clear.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_08_03">Looks like someone called the cops! Guys, protect Charon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_18_any_01">Nice, bring the money to the van.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_intro_a_03">Keep an eye on the heat guys don&apos;t want cops here too soon. Avoid cameras and guards. Take any extra jewels they have if you can. We leave with the same van we came in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_69_07">Keep the cops away from the routers! </string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_end_a_01">Ernesto Sosa never saw it coming. With him dead, the Sosa&apos;s Miami operations lie in ruins. My point has been made.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_03_01">Hurry up Goddamnit!</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_12_02">I got it. I didn&apos;t fuck up! I didn&apos;t fuck up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_10_02">Great. Now go blast that obstruction. It&apos;s your way out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_43_01">Just go over to the switch and pick the difficulty.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_end_02_02">Not only did you boost a crapload of cash, this caper wiped millions off Benevolent&apos;s share price. Great work!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_14">Grab the oh-shit handles!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_19_03">Woah, the Commissar has a lot of coke here, but he&apos;s employing scorched earth tactics like a true Russian. In other words: He&apos;s flushing the product and if you don&apos;t get there fast, you miss out on a whole lot of extra income!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_17_04">The routine has been interrupted, get it restarted, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_16_02">One of these is the truck carrying the voting machines to Washington. When you think you know which one it is, get the tracker on it and we can move on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_56_02">OK, drill&apos;s done. Get into the basement.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_17_04">No bullets with Garrett&apos;s name on them tonight, OK friends?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_15_02">Just maritime regulations and shipping forecasts. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_24_01">Gang, the cops have the city locked down. Fighting through is the only option, so we need you on the ground. That means the truck is going to stay with you. </string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_41_02">Why aren&apos;t you leaving?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_11">...this is not my area of expertise.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_66_03">Alright you chops, time to act nice and casual. Take off your masks and walk calmly out of there. </string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_79_04">You need to patch me into those boxes, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_71_04">You need to move to the skylight.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_03_03">You got &apos;em! Now get back to Operations!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_62_03">It&apos;s a blank. Keep searching.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_78_03">Let&apos;s finish this the old-fashioned way, yeah? Put a hacking connector on the boxes so I can patch in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_30_04">You better be bringing the box, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_intro_01">A nice quiet day in L.A.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_24_03">Bile can&apos;t get in close unless you clear the area of cops!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_48_05">Bring the key to our friend!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_01_03">That&apos;s it, the hidden train yard. Use this opportunity to scout the area. The place is heavily guarded by Murkies and cameras, so we can&apos;t afford to make any mistakes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_40_02">That corridor isn&apos;t short, is it. Built to take a couple nukes, it was.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_01x_01">Hello again, guys. This is...uh, Ghost Rider. Expect me in...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_e_02">Find some, and pour it in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_81_07">Get all the loot onto the zipline.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_04_07">Ah thank you. And may I say, you two are the finest dressed nurses in the whole hospital.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_05_02">Fantastic! The vault should be exposed now. Time to crack &apos;em open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_42_03">Old Locke thinks the vault is behind those doors...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_85_03">Don&apos;t let them turn the power off again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_21_03">Come on, chums. No dawdling. Light that flare for me!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_52_02">Find a good formula yet, friends?</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_41_03">The coppers have taken the winch offline! </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_42_06">Get the valve open again, crew!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_45_02">Prying that open felt really good. Now check what&apos;s underground!</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_02_07">The best part is, if we actually manage to pull this off, we can talk about it all we want!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_37_03">Look for clues in Garrett&apos;s investigation, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_02_01">It&apos;s the Hondurans! They fucking followed us! Shit!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_01_01">You&apos;re in civilian mode. No guns, no masks - invisible to security. When you&apos;re ready, find your gear. Micho the janitor left it in a guitar case somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_end_a_01">That was easy. Nice work. Unfortunately Hector just told me the FBI has nabbed the remaining Mendoza and are escorting them to the airport in a convoy. Which means we don&apos;t have much time.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_80_03">Bah, surveillance didn&apos;t show that. Well, you gotta get through it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_96_02">Well, what have we here. Only the Maretto&apos;s cargo manifest. Now we know which containers may hold loot. Good find.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_01_any_01">Alright, do you see the house? Get inside and find the server room. We need to hack into the security system to get to the lab.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_04_01">I don&apos;t think we have a choice. We have to spin that wheel!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_05_02">Did you find it yet? Have you checked the upper floor?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_05b_any_03">...Almost there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_80_03">Got to move that ship. I have an idea. If you can hack the ship control terminal and keep the fuzz off it, should be able to guide it remotely.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_51_01">Just one more bag.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_32_03">Ok! Just protect the winches now while they&apos;re working.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_71_06">Go to the skylight with the box.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_111_03">Got something on the way for you that&apos;s going to be a kakspul of trouble for that vault!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_intro_a_01b">The owner is nuts about security. Escape van will be near the dropoff.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_54_03">Start collecting extra loot if you want to friends, it&apos;s time to get you out of there, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_27_02">Nicely done. Now how about we plug it into a laptop?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_20_02">You gotta get the lights back on quickly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_71_01">That&apos;s it! Downloading. Give it a moment.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_08_05">How is it going with the key tag?</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_15_01">Get the briefcase! The thermite will burn right through that gate.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_43_02">That&apos;s it, yeah? Pick it up and keep moving.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_08_04">You still gotta hack into those access points.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_21_any_02">House is beyond those trees, see? Sneak right up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_07_04">Watch out, more snipers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_55_01">Damn! The timelock has jammed. Your ECM jammers must be interfering with it! Wait for it to resume.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_09_05">It&apos;s soda, caustic soda.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_47_03">After you!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_45_01">Keep an eye out for Garrett, yeah? He must be on his way back by now.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_06_05b">Hey! Come back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_46_02">The Commissar is holed up somewhere around Georgetown. Find a clue. Something to do with Georgetown.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_14_01">He&apos;s going to drop off the pieces for a skyhook. You gotta bolt together an aluminum cage, load it and then send up a cable on a balloon. Plane flies right over, grabs the cable and - whoosh! - off it goes. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_12_05">Find keycards, gang. Check the buildings.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_20_01">The safe, friends. Use the print.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_01a">Remind me again why we&apos;re doing this?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_06_02">Chopper will be back for the rest of you. Use the time well - look around for the product. Vlad said it&apos;s stashed in packages.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_13_03">You need to actually use the keycard, you know?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_35_01">Looks like we are doing this loud, gents! The panic room&apos;s locked down so we do this the hard way. Bile will get us a thermal lance. Hang on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_06_03">He&apos;s headed up. Look for the stairways up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_09_03">That&apos;s the alarm. MPD response channels just went crazy. OK, no matter. Keep hacking those machines.</string>
	 <string id="plc_cs1_04_01">Son, you have exactly two minutes to put them here on this phone, or I&apos;m sending every goddamn available uniform right now.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_end_b_03">You have demonstrated that the Sosa Cartel does not own the Caribbean. With sufficient emphasis, I believe.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_05_02">Just a minute. I have to open the door!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_05_02">Bain said it could happen but I didn&apos;t believe him. Good thing I got you out of Washington, eh?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_02_03">I&apos;m going to clear off for a while. Good hunting.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_49_02">You can use those keycards in the control rooms. Just swipe &apos;em, open the dock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_08_03">The front is shut tight. Take a walk around. Find another way in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_52a_03">Gha, find the breaker and get the juice flowing again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_54_03">A superb execution. Quiet and discreet. But Gensec won&apos;t be able to hide what happened here. Nice work!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_intro_03">I&apos;m fired up about this one, gang. Chavez will have no idea what hit him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_end_b_01">You got most of it and most of it is better than none of it. Hector will be happy with how you handled yourself. Got to get to the boat now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_21_02">Safeties off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_21_02">All right. Let&apos;s get it over to where we need it. Find the crane controls.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_86_02">The keycard we need is in the Oval Office, so get inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_19_any_03">Hell of a good move to use the tunnels - they&apos;ll be off-balance.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_23_08b">Everybody fucking shooting at me... Bullshit...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_123_03">Damn, no sign of the comm frequency. My guess is it&apos;ll be at the control room across the dock.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_44_01">Kerels stopped the device. Get back and rearm it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_55_03">Ah, bravo! We&apos;re fueled and ready to go. Please, make your way aboard and let us get out of here. This was a fine day.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_04_01">Great! Now that he&apos;s safe, I&apos;m sending a helicopter to pick him up. Stay with him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_49_01">Hey boss, I got a sealed letter for you here. Says for your eyes only.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_17_02">Nice friends. More crystal gold!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_87_01">What are you waiting for? Go into the Oval Office!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_64_01">Come on friends, get him moving.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_30_01">You did good. Better than I thought you would, to be honest. We got what we came for, and I bet we can get a good payday from that gold you stole. Should be more than enough to get you started again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_21_01">You&apos;ll need to overheat the secondary servers. Turning off the flow of coolant should do it.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_09_02">Time&apos;s up. I&apos;m dispatching a team and notifying the police.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_27_01">SWATS are hitting ground floor. Right staircase.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_13_02">Find the goods. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll know it when you see it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_02_any_03">OK you&apos;re in, good. Now you need at least four paintings, the good ones have red stickers - those are the ones our art lover intends to buy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_intro_04">What are you blaming me for? This wasn&apos;t my idea!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_06_03">Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Jack Frost snorting up his nose...</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_21_any_03">The house is right across and through the woods. Leg it. </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_04_01">...You gotta find the security boxes that control the doors and run a bypass on them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_brf_03_01">We&apos;re using a magnetic crane to drop a little present in the path of the Gensec convoy - a steel container of professional badasses. Hit the trucks, and get the loot to the getaway. These docks have a rich history of heistery, gentlemen - do it proud.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_05_01">You&apos;ll close this out quicker if you use the car to move the goats.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_43_01">Fanny&apos;s!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_72_03">All&apos;s quiet still. Good work. Stay hidden while the Moretta docks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_07_01">Okay, I&apos;m trying to hack the security system now...</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_12_any_01">Guys, the first batch is unloaded - I&apos;m coming back for more!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_95_03">Hurry up and take all you can!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_18_02">We&apos;re going for a roof pick-up. Start shifting those bags to the top of the bank and put the cage together.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_18_03">That&apos;s the last one. My advice? Get far away, as fast as you can!.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_41_02">More dwankies coming soon. You gotta get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_69_03">The Murky&apos;s nest egg is cash money, so start looking. It could be anywhere around there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_94_03">Good. That ate right through. Now get inside!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_53_03">Right, that&apos;s part one yeah? Time to add the next compound.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_20_any_07">Looking at this site... Says acid is used in this step... We got muriatic, right?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_82_03">Time to fly, friends. Get onboard that dinges, quickly!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_82_02">You need to get the elevator going again. Restore the power.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_61_03">Turn on the power again to get the code!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_07_any_02">He&apos;ll be coming in at dock 9.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_46_03">Great. Now the second card in the other panel, and the Moretta will be free.</string>
	 <string id="rb1_bph_intro_04d">Hang in there Bain, we&apos;re here to get you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_17_03">OK. So you need a key and a code. Well, at least we know what you need to look for.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_24_03">Okay! Now go find a gas can. Shoot it to set the paintings on fire.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_18_03">I don&apos;t think he&apos;ll last much longer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_27_01">Now stop any pursuit. Blow that gas!</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_34a_01">*loudly sings Ride of the Valkyries by Wagner*</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_59_03">Ah crap! Security locked the containers when the alarm was triggered. Looks like we&apos;re drilling.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_33_01">I need all of you in the boat, as soon as possible, thank you very fucking much.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_45_01">All right, get those fireworks onto the terrace.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_intro_a_01">Right, this is the place. Get to the traincar and look for your contact. They said they&apos;d meet you there. So far it all looks good. Just trade the paintings and get out fast. Keep it rolling.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_lookout_sniper_02">Those snipers wont leave you alone anytime soon. One of you should keep an eye on those roofs at all times!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_end_02">Some pretty sweet snatch and grab back there. I bet they&apos;re going to invest in better security measures, or close. Not our problem. </string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_27_03">Let&apos;s see what goodies they have!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_02_02">There might be janitors and other civvies in the building, so take extra care.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_48_02">Okay. Now hold them off til the thermite finishes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_45_02">That guy could&apos;ve slipped us past the retinal scanner but not anymore. Ah well. Time for the back-up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_46_03">Almost open. Remember, you deal with the radars, and I will prepare the helicopter.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_65_01">Outstanding, gang! I wish all trips to the bank ended so happily.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_12_02">Commissar is throwing everything he has left! Even his damned gunship! Keep your distance!</string>
	 <string id="plt_as1_02_03">Authorities are trying to boost my bird. But injured civs don&apos;t pay so well. I&apos;ll be with you in 2.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_13_02">Use that ladder to climb onto the wagons.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_59_01">That&apos;s one hell-of-a explosion team! Grab the goods!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_56_03">Keep looking in the sanctum rooms!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_08">Half the fucking police force is on our ass!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_snipers_nearby_03">Stay low! Snipers have got you pinned!</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_05_any_01">I can see seven paintings.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_22_03">That&apos;s the first batch. Find the rest. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_62_03">Almost there... almost there...</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_19_04">Still waiting on that phone hookup.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_23_01">If he gives you any trouble, break some fingers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_01_01">Drop them, crew!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_31_03">Why would Gensec have a truck out there?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_37_03">You need to find a way in there, somehow. </string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_05_03">They should be safe, but... any of you feel like little teeth feeding on your bone marrow?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_02a">So what kind of shit are we going to find in this place?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_57_03">Keep it clear until it&apos;s done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_01_01">Remember, stay low, stay dark. And stay quiet. Here we go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_77_03">The pilot can&apos;t circle around there forever, get that smoke out! </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_63_01">I&apos;m hearing over the comms that they&apos;ve set up a sniper ambush ahead. Watch your heads!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_10">What the fuck did you guys steal!?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_05_02">Get inside the store and take the clerk hostage, so we can make a trade with the cops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_10_01">Oh, shiny! Whoever looted this liked the finer stuff.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_19_01">Nice haul! This will bring in a nice chunk of change. Good job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_29_03">Just like St Nazaire! </string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_12_01">Come on, get that vault open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_random_stage1_intro_a_02">Robbery time. Get the thermal drill stashed in the parking lot. Then it&apos;s up to you. I don&apos;t know what we&apos;re gonna get here but remember: keep the civilians in check, don&apos;t let &apos;em use alarms or phones. See you at the safe house.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_107_02">.. or take a little more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_13_02">Secure the loot bags in the motorboat you arrived in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_06_01">That&apos;s the left panel. Now search for the other keycard. Get the other panel activated.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_04_02">Patching in Vlad...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_06_03">The laptop should be near the house, maybe in one of the smaller buildings?</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_04_01">Guys, it feels like something&apos;s in the air... Money!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_73_03">No need to stay any longer, friends. If you&apos;re ready, go for extraction.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_07_03b">Fuck! I don&apos;t wanna die today!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_35_02">OK, we&apos;re doing it loud! The panic room is locked down, so I&apos;m sending you a thermal lance. Stand by.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_01_any_03">Look - those doors aren&apos;t going to hold up when they start shooting.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_22_01">They&apos;ve stopped the crane, get it moving again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_104_04">You need to activate the crane.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_65_04">We need something to help light this up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_22_01">The display cases are now disconnected from the alarm. If you want to grab some extra souvenirs, now is the time.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_84_01">Looks like we found our man!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_15_03">There might be more chemicals in the trucks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_66_02">Guys, switchboards just lit up. Guess that&apos;s the alarm.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_07_01">Good. Now, try lock picking that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_19_01">Collect the cage bags. You need to assemble it in the street.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_58_01">Throw the BFD&apos;s switch! Let the show begin!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_24_03">There&apos;s a card reader by the security bars. Open it up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_10_01">Woah! Bulldozer in the truck! Take him out! I guess they were expecting trouble.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_17_03">You need to use the saws for our plan to work. Two on the second floor and two on the fourth floor. Get going.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_02e">This shit really what we want to be talking about?</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_19_any_01">I can&apos;t stay for long!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_33_02">Good going. Only one more color-number set to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_26_02">Nearly got it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_end_b_01">Guys... Guys... Guys. We were supposed to get info... Not just cash. Hector&apos;s going to skin me alive. </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_55_01">Right, the fuel tank is full, the blades are spinning and the cargo is secure. Time to get out of here. Gentlemen, please join me aboard!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_92_08">Don&apos;t screw this up. The code&apos;s...</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_87_02">You gotta hang on a bit, chopper is coming.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_06">...I&apos;m sure. I&apos;m pretty sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_115_01">Come on, guys, hustle it. You need to move fast to pull this off.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_04_02">Could be a while. Was it left at the Union or....?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_41_01">No need to stay, get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_54_02">Gotta get that winch running again, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_04_any_01">We&apos;re looking for a Gensec security door - the security room is in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_19_03">The keys are in the storage room. Grab &apos;em!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_16_01">The train is rapidly approaching the cop barricade. I give you a maximum of two minutes to secure the loot and get out.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_23_02">Yeah I know the way! I was planning to escape myself!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_12_02">Alright. I need you to do one more errand before you bug out. Get to the security room and grab the footage from the cameras. Just in case they got anything incriminating.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_23_03">To get past Garrett&apos;s code lock, you&apos;ll have to disable a few security boxes in the area.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_11_01">That&apos;s the last one! Have a look inside!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_53_03">Might be a good idea to look outside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_30_03">Exit is just ahead. You guys need to get out of that gear pronto. The cops will be able to track that stench.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_10_01b">Okay, so we&apos;re gonna need a heart for this baby. An engine. That&apos;s what I mean. I think they store them inside the clubhouse.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_03a_any_04">I&apos;m coming in four...</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_03_01">Ok, you have to go to the Jewelry store.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_11_03">Damn, the cops are bringing everything they have to get you, and you&apos;re gonna be surrounded if you don&apos;t leave now. Hurry up and escape via the canal route. Now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_08_any_02">Get the power to the server back on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_13_02">You need to pick up the pace. Get that bag to Mr. Blonde.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_10_any_02">That&apos;s half the required paintings, you need to get the rest before we can roll out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_19_03">The getaway plane is probably still in one of the hangars.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_gwa_01">Here they come! Prepare to beat them back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_77_02">This leads all the way to the beach, crew!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_02_01">Truck&apos;s ready?</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_52_02">Seven bucks! All right!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_15_04">There you go. Now take a look inside the vault room,  yeah?</string>
	 <string id="rb1_bph_intro_03e">And big fiery explosions?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_07_01">From what we know, Buluc keeps to himself a lot, when not holding court, so you&apos;ll probably find him in his office. See if you can find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_29_02">Okay. Mask up when you&apos;re ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_99_01">See that drive thru window at the side of the bank? There&apos;s a manhole there to the sewers. Get down there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_19_01">Look outside the Jade Room, looks like a laptop.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_06_04">Kind of a busy day friends, we have that big white building to take care of, so don&apos;t dally.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_09_any_02">I told you guys to be ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_01_03">Ok gang, you know what we&apos;re here for. Go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_25_03">There&apos;s a slot for the keycard. My guess is just put it in and see what happens...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_09_02">Nice. Now get it back to the loot drop. </string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_intro_02_03">Right, Vlad. Right.$NL;</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_64_02">I&apos;ve come up with a plan B, just find those routers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_03_07">The car we&apos;re after is in the front, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_har_04_01">Hate to see you guys cooped up like that, but we snagged four trucks. Get out there, and get at them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_36_05">You still need to get the managers keycard. Find him!</string>
	 <string id="plt_flt_06_01">Gentlemen, the C4 is on the roof.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_29_03">Blerrie, can&apos;t get to the chopper unless you extend the walkway. Find the control room and get it done!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_05_01">Good, now take hose to fuel pump.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_48_03">Get inside the bank now, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_86_04">Bile can&apos;t land until you get those guns down.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_25_06">Come on, recode that key tag.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_41_any_04">All broken and smoking this one. Get me a fresh one from the lab.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrasch_stage1_brief_01b">Enough destruction and this client will rethink his whole stance on protection money. Dirty job but you like getting dirty, right?</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_36_02">Excellent! Now get back, because things are about to blow.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_39_01">Get the water hose running.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_91_03">Clean up the square and streets around the bank.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_22_01">You know, there may be a better way in than going through the gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_39_03">The scan has been completed.Well done, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_19">Throw in another gear, will ya? That pile of coke is getting smaller at an alarming pace!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_48_any_01">Aw, that&apos;s a civilian casualty! Be careful!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_14_01">The chopper&apos;s coming to the lumber yard - be ready!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_115_01">You&apos;ve seen this vault type before, not too long ago. Some nitriogen would crack it, but we&apos;ll have to get in some other way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_82_03">That was easy! Now go find our friend!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_01_01">All right, gang, up ahead is Chavez&apos; crib.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_33_02">Now put the car in the container, get out and we can close this caper.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_58_02">Stick a blocker on the keypad to stop the code cycle.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_28_01">Ok, the pilot just confirmed that he&apos;s landed his passenger safely! You can go home, guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_81_03">Murkys will try to interrupt my hack! Stop them!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_45_03">That&apos;s it. That&apos;s it! You&apos;re almost here, come on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_67_02">This system is built to be simple. All you got to do is choose a vault and press a button. Easy, yeah? For sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_50_03">Mr Blonde can&apos;t escape unless you create that diversion guys!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_03a_any_01">I&apos;m there in four...</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_05_02">You wankers ever think we&apos;d get this far?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_86_02">Ach, now you&apos;ve got to drill through the door instead.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_06_03">Stay on your toes. This&apos;s gonna be tense.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_06_01">Is everything alright over there?</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_05_06">Aah christ in a handbag, are you two cops?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_08_03">That&apos;s the first fan. Temperature&apos;s rising. Jam more fans to speed things up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_10_01">Got it. Doors should be open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_dow_02_01">Well, our explosives guy delivered. Two transports have stopped. Get to work!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_12_03">Ah, the elevator is broken! How inconvenient! Listen - since I can&apos;t get up, I need you to search for something important that they took from me. It&apos;s a metal briefcase. I must have it back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_16_03">Now light up those tires. Get the gas on them. That&apos;ll deal with the chopper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_25_02">Remember to help Charon out of here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_09_01">Bliksem, the place is rigged! Get out of there if you can&apos;t disarm it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_11_02">The traitor will be in the panic room, so you have to find it. Then we can work on getting it open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_16_03">I have access. While you&apos;re waiting for me, grab the C4 from the van and get it planted in the street.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_25_04">Remember, that key tag needs recoding.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_07_02">Connecting now. Better pray this is the right one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_01_03">You saved the mechanic just in time. Now help him off the chair and make him assemble the bike.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_22_01">Now let&apos;s see what happens!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_35_01">Ok, now you need a keycard. Find Ralph Garnet and take it from him. He should be around there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_28_03">Only one vault can be opened at a time. Further, only certain vaults have loot within them. How that is determined is up to you, but I have confidence in your ability.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_21_01">Ach! That&apos;s a Franz Jäger Mark II.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_56_02">Can&apos;t stand around there all day. Get to it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_end_c_01b">Mendozas are headed for the airport. Bring that briefcase. I bet we can figure out something to do with it.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_07_02">Start fuel transfer with pump.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_51_03">All right! Thermite&apos;s done. Now get down there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_14_02">Great, that&apos;s him! Get him out of there and to the top of the tower!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_13_03">You need to find Garrett&apos;s office.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_72_01">Done! We&apos;re through with loading up. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme...</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_06_03">Thanks! My wrists hurt like hell!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_04a_03">Find those electrical boxes yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_158_02">I don&apos;t... know...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_04_03">Pilot dropped the supplies. Get them into the house.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_04_03">What are you blaming me for? This wasn&apos;t my idea!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_14_02">Use the key to open the red door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_29_04">Friends, get some thermite on that vault door, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_16_02">You have approximately two minutes before the train reaches the barricade. You hear me? Two minutes.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_07_01">OK, you&apos;re in! I&apos;ve sent a security clearance request. You need to approve it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_75_01">They have no clue you are there. Now get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_11_any_01">Don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s just for safety.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_30_01">The server room is locked down. We can&apos;t get in there now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_22_01">That&apos;s a blerrie strong door, too tough for the drill. Better check the armory for something to open it with.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_03_03">Don&apos;t cry, Bain. It&apos;s all fine. Buyer pays big for them. They&apos;re very far away.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_30_03">That is a good amount of loot, friends. Enough to make this worthwhile. Still, if you feel like you still got a little lead in your pencil and wanted to fuck Murkywater a little longer... you can get more.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_19_02b">Oh! I almost forgot! I need one more... special ingredient. Yeah, that&apos;s right. The mechanic needs a coke from the vending machine. Chop chop, pretty please.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_03_05">I fucking hate war movies.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_14">They&apos;re on to us like a fucking sticker!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_37_03">Keep the cops busy and the drill will be through in no time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_14_03">I said it&apos;s time to go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_15_any_04">Goddammit, you just missed the getaway.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_72_03">Good show! Time to break the man out! Find the cell block.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_45_01">You&apos;ve got Murkys coming!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_56_02">Can&apos;t let them all away...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_30_01">Clues to the right computer are in the office. Come on, hustle!</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_29_03">I lost the pigs guys, thanks! See you in a bit. And bring me a burger!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_50_01">That&apos;s half of &apos;em.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_52_any_01">We&apos;re just getting started!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_14_any_03">OK, that&apos;s one bag down! We need at least three more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_25_any_03">Find the server room. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_47_01">Chopper is down. Get the loot in, and get out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_83_04">Fly you fools!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_end_b_02b">Then we just need to go in to get the gold.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_14_01">Hey! I&apos;m not leaving without MY car!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_99_02">Ooh, nice bit of hardware, that! Going to be useful for sure!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_59a_01">Check the area all around the safe.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_intro1_01">Guys, I will try to get you an escape plan and find out what the bloody blazes is going on, yeah? The warehouse should still be safe for a quick breather.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_28_03">Hang in there, Bain old friend. Not going to lose you now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_25_01">Quite the view, huh? Well, I&apos;ve got something else to show you. Get to the control booth.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_39_03">A crowbar. Good find. Always useful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_22_01">Put in the flash drive and get started.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_39_02">All right. Now let&apos;s shift that loot before they realise what&apos;s happened.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_31_03">The first bag! Bellissimo! Now, close to the vaults you will find a tall vertical shaft with cables. Attach the bags to the cables, and they will be lifted to me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_12_01">Whoah, that is some crash!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_33_03">Okay, now get those bags into the truck and we can call this one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_12_01">Remember, you&apos;re looking for keycards. Check the buildings.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_53_02">No way out the front. Quick! Get into the container. You&apos;re leaving with the loot. Don&apos;t think about the drop, okay?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_05_03">The kerel boss will have the files on his computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_02_02a">Remember that the EMP bomb is two parts and I don&apos;t have to remind you we need both.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_12_any_01">Look at all these nice things. Must have done a lot of public service in his career.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_05_03">Okay, give me a minute or two. I&apos;ll disable this AA gun.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_89_01">I can&apos;t get supplies to you- they would just get suspicious and shoot me down, so have a look around while I think of something.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_08_02">You shitheads will never get in here! I&apos;ll make you dead!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_24_01">Ah! There it is! Now, please, out of the airlock and into the inner complex!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_brief_01">This is the senator&apos;s apartment. Nice neighborhood, high security though. He&apos;s already got the paintings hung, so our cameras are online and transmitting.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_52_03">Get a zipline up if you want. It&apos;d be great for moving the bags.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_15_02">You know the Romanovs, eh?</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_21_02">That will do! Start getting them out and into the truck!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_17_03">The hack routine needs to be rebooted, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_67_06">Alright, restart the computer and we&apos;ll be back online again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_09_any_02">The wheelman&apos;s going to be there in one minute with the escape van.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_17_any_04">Out! Out of the bus now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_can_intro_03">All right. The so-called toyshop. Just ahead.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_75_03">Any luck with finding the armory?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_37_01">Great. Now get to the zip-line and you&apos;re job is done.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_134_02">There we go, wonderful! Now get inside the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_137_02">You can move out of the PEOC now!</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_12_03">&apos;Course I brought it. Cabots don&apos;t hire morons.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_16_02">Groot, friends. We got what we need. Make more if you want or leave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_16_02">Open those Murkywater containers. If anything has illegal loot, it will be them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_22_02">You need to turn off those valves at the bottom of the server rack.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_05_any_02">The boat is coming in at dock 7.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_98_03">You can use the modified drill I sent with you to get through. </string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_08_02">Getting access...</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_54_01">You need to patch me in so I can open those doors.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_36_03">An active ECM jammer will make it harder to access the server room. So use them with caution.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_30_02">Just get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_35_any_01">Did you check the whole place? Check the whole place!</string>
	 <string id="pt2_cs1_02_01">The roof? Are you fucking nuts, Sensei? I&apos;m not doing that.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_108_02">Ach, another security failsafe. You&apos;re going to need to drill yourselves out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_32_01">Found those keys yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_15_01">What do you see? This place is bone dry. Nevermind, we did what we came for, so just get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_32_02">See that nice big hole? Drive through it, and hit the gas!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_12_01">Every 10 minutes, the vault gets a new code. Stick a blocker unit on the keypad to stop it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_02_01">Search around for a ladder. You&apos;ll need it for the wagons.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_14_01">Shit, gas, gas!!! Get out! Move it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_17_01">Okay, with that mess taken care of, it&apos;s time to find the server room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_86_01">Guys! The power! Keep it on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_07_any_01">Damn it! They&apos;ve turned of the power to the server! Get it back up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_40_01">Okay, our friend will know the way out, right? You just have to watch out for the guards.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_07_any_05">Alright, I found video of him doing the deal... It is insane. He sure is a show-off.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_71_05">No time for a tortilla break, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_04_01">If you don&apos;t have a door, you make one. Time to use the blowtorch.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_99_01">Nice, yeah? That torch is going to be useful later!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_09_01">103!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_48_02">Get rid of those biker keks!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_19_02">Shit, the mercenaries stopped the EMP charge! It&apos;s beginning to discharge!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_14_03">Get that to a safe place and we can start up another braai.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_13_any_01">Looks like the alarm is already off. Get the door open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_07_any_02">Get everyone into the train.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_07_03">You should find evidence related to Hoxton&apos;s case in the Evidence Room. Get searching.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_70a_02">Those things need to be put onboard the plane.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_03_02">First, grab some ephedrine tablets and throw &apos;em in the mixer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_03_03">Okay. So. Ephedrine will start the alchemy. Get some tablets in the mixer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_21_any_01">Don&apos;t forget about those safe deposit boxes folks, can be good stuff in there.</string>
	 <string id="mer_jr1_intro_01_01">Intruders! Fire!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_01_01">Surveillance shows metal detectors all around the entrance, so you gotta find a way past them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_49_02">Did any of you grab that second can? Extra thermite means extra heat which means less time.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_08_02">Alright, we will probably need every little bit of cash after this and my stash of emergency krugerrand was confiscated by Interpol, so go find that saw, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_11_03">Now use the security cameras and try to locate Bain&apos;s cell.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_53_02">You&apos;ll need to get to Buluc&apos;s secret meeting room to find the way into his personal office. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_04_03">Good. I&apos;m sending a chopper to collect him. Keep him safe. He&apos;s so wasted I doubt he&apos;d feel the bullets.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_17_02">That&apos;s it! Doing a background check now. Hold on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_16">Stay focused! Keep moving up! They&apos;re wasting coke like they were trained for this!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_23_05b">Jesus... how the fuck did I get involved in this bullshit...</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cs1_10_01">Nononono! Shit! I&apos;m going down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_19_04">How are you doing tracking down those two keycards?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_10_02">It&apos;s behind that security door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_15_03">Keep going, keep trashing!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_12_02">Okay, now wait for the pilot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_45_01">Put the explosives on the door.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_26e_02">So long you fucker!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_21_02">You gotta use a drill on the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_04a_01">Get going friends, no time to waste. Open those doors.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_22_03">I think that is the armor of Oda Nabunaga. This is serious loot, gang. Load up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_02_01">You can expect the security to be very tight, cameras and everything.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_43_03">Use the saw and cut through the roof, then drag his ass out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_12_any_01">Alright, I&apos;m in, hold on...</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_16_01">Guys, you need to find a blowtorch otherwise we&apos;re screwed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_81_02">Listen up, the code is...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_16_02">Great! We&apos;re in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_94_01">The cops are using the ladders. Watch them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_28_02">My sensors are picking up another panel on the top floor - get to it if you&apos;ve had enough and want to leave.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_73_05">Keep looking for that cell block!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_138_03">The Murkys have got AA defenses set up and I can&apos;t get through to pick you up while they are active!</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_06_03">Some weird shit happening on this job.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_39_03">Get the lance working on the door. Burn through to that snitch!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_end_01_02">That&apos;s how the pros do it! Chalk it up. Payday Gang one, Armadillo corp zero.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_12_01">Excellent, you found a keycard. Now, head back to the train and open that sucker.</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_14_any_01">Great, money coming down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_29_03">What the hell guys? This confirms the setup!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_48_01">Chopper&apos;s here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_end_02_01">It was messy but you got the job done. Good job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_27_01">Streetlight is down. Grab the goat!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_23_01">Perfect, I knew you could be trusted, Alex.</string>
	 <string id="sys_hb2_08_03">Access approved.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_03_01">You need to get inside the building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_65_02">Great job. Now get in the car and let&apos;s end this. Or hang around and really clean the joint.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_07_01">Bag of cash, great. But let&apos;s pay off that asshole first. Yellow wall by the auto-repair shop. Don&apos;t worry, we&apos;ll find and deal with him later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_22_03">Hold up guys! The vault is wired!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_62_03">Hurry and turn the power back on. Chop chop!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_07_03">You need to find a way into the control room, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_03_03">If you find a laptop at the computer station, I could use it to help you.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_19">We got a fucking police caravan on our ass!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_17_02">Ok, now get the keycard from the auctioneer. Quietly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_33_any_02">OK, doctors - bring your MIT skills. Figure out which one is the correct fusion engine. Go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_82_03">Never going to get in that vault without the Beast. Set it up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_28_02">That&apos;s all three digits for the code. Head to the vault, let&apos;s see if they work.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_65_03">Of all the vaults, you had to open an empty one! Try again, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_45_02">SWATS are coming in from the north!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_46_01">They spotted you! Kerels are on the way soon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_22_02">Great. Now find something else to steal. We need to make it look like a simple robbery.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_93_03">This is one of the vault codes. Remember it. We&apos;re going to be needing it before we close this caper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_24_01">Set the zip-line up on the roof, then haul ass to the crane.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_25_02">Sure I saw this place in a movie. Hope the walls don&apos;t spit poison darts.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_63_03">Hey gang, you got trouble comin&apos; by helicopter.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_33_01">Both drills done. Excellent.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_50_01">Okay, friends, let us now move the lootbags to the helicopter. Do not dawdle now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_14_03">We need to get inside the lumber mill. Why not see if you could use the anti-air gun we hacked earlier and redirect its position? Might be worth a shot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_04_02">That&apos;s the stuff. Keep going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_48_01">What, are you mind readers? Yes, I do want that briefcase. How did you know?</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_02_01">Get the mechanic to start working on Rust&apos;s bike. Just do as he says and get him what he needs.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_04_03b">Shit on a stick, here they come!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_17_02">Hurry up you chops, get into that tunnel.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_28_any_01">Oh check this out. I recognize some of this. Our old loot.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_132_01">They deployed a gun turret! Stay low!</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_03_05">Hey, hold the door!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_88_03">There&apos;s something wrong with the drill. You gotta repair it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_07_06">Wait a blerrie minute!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_24_02">Have a look at the card reader by the security bars. Get it open, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_107_01">That was the last components, now mix it all together.... carefully</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_04_01">OK, keep hidden from the neighbours view people. Let&apos;s not have anyone call the boys in blue.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_18_01">Alright, I got it! The storage room is now unlocked. Go get the car keys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_32_03">That&apos;s the hatch! I&apos;ve got an idea for it. Bile is going to be Santa, and since you&apos;re such good boys and girls...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_30_01">Guys, take him to the retinal scanner and force him to use it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_07_to_departure">The escape vehicle is leaving in seven minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_76_02">Hit the elevator button.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_66_01">Neighbors must&apos;ve heard gunshots. Police signals just went nuts.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_54_02">That&apos;s the first console. Now the second.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_96_03">When you feel ready, make your escape!</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_07_any_01">OK, I count 5 paintings. </string>
	 <string id="pt2_cs1_03_02">Roof, alright I got it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_01_any_01">OK, time to burn some money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_09_02">That was intense, gang. Locke already sent over our share. Still uneasy about him, but let&apos;s see where things go with this guy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_76_01">There is no time to waste, get the code and open the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_109_04">Chopper&apos;s not leaving without you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_30_03">If you&apos;re planning on sticking around for extra loot, that crowbar will do the trick.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_15_02">Hope that cable holds. Wait, did I add the weight of the safes...?</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_02_02">Vlad&apos;s very keen on talking to you on this one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_56_02">Ernesto is always paranoid, so once you start making that call you better finish it. Treat it like a pager</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_16_03">Get back to the van, clowns. Time to haul ass out of this clusterfuck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_regular_a_intro_a_05">This branch bank is ready for the taking. Let&apos;s do this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_111_02">Just let them go quietly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_09_01">Get that back to the drop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_40_01">The van&apos;s outside. Get stowing that loot!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_66_01">There&apos;s your ride out. Once you&apos;ve got all the loot secured, you gotta get it refueled. </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_17_03">Whose shooting?! Someone must&apos;ve heard that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_16_06">Don&apos;t let the guy lag behind!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_26_01">They&apos;re opening the building left and right!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_68_03">That&apos;s the front and the upstairs dark as far as cameras are concerned. Cameras in the vault area run on a seperate circuit though.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_72_03">There we go. Now you just got to send it out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_75_01">Now check the screen for the code, then go and open the vault.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_16_01">Hey, was that the vault? Can&apos;t argue with your sense of style.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_05_05">Clear the street!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_66_02">Gensec on the scene. You&apos;ve bloodied their noses before, prepare to do it again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_44_01">They probably keep the keys near the cars. Have a look around.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_46_01">Do not forget. Take out those radars. I&apos;ll get the chopper ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_09_03">Has that tricky bastard vanished?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_03_03">That&apos;s a tunnel entrance if ever I&apos;ve seen one.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_07_03">Whooooooo! Yeah, man. Yeah! Whoooooooooo!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_22_01">The cops stopped the bridge. Use the controls to keep it turning!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_36_03">Look around for a ladder. I&apos;m sure that with energy properly applied to a search you will profit. For sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_21_any_01">That&apos;s the alarm, hurry inside so we can get that server.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_34_01">Ach, the pump again. Donnerse thing needs more gas.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_04_01">Head inside the room and go through with the drug deal.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_32_any_01">That&apos;s the damn alarm! Time to shift to plan B, folks. </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_43_01">The entire compound heard that blast. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_31_02">I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve seen all the tasty loot in the vault. Stash it in the chopper if you can stay a little longer.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_104_01">Use the crane to bring back the crate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_24_02">Get the flash drive and leave. And, Dallas, don&apos;t let them see you on the way out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_08_02">Oh, there&apos;s a lot of firepower here! The guys will assemble the cage at the bridge.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_59_02">All doors have keys. If you want to do this quietly, find the keys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_44_01c">You what?</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_17_01">You gotta get through that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_09_01">Great, you found some evidence! Analyze it in the lab. Let&apos;s see if there&apos;s any trace of the traitor&apos;s DNA on it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_05_any_02">Go ahead and burn it. I know, it&apos;s sad...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_12_01">Since this got messy, we&apos;ve gotta do some clean up. Find the security room and grab the camera footage. They might have caught something we don&apos;t want them to.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_12_05">Come on guys! Move to the next building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_27_01">Only one left.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_34_any_02">Check his papers, notes and computers. Anything for a hint on what is correct here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_74_01">That door is too thick, the drill won&apos;t be enough. Maybe the armory has the cure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_95_01">The weapons will need fresh batteries.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_15_01">OK, now get into the vault room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_17_03">Great! Now, hit that button, drop the bollards and get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_50_01">Get to the bio-lab.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_63_01">That worked better than I anticipated. You didn&apos;t do anything to it, by any chance?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_27_any_01">Sweet that is some good old loot...</string>
	 <string id="plc_cs1_01_01">This is Captain Rogers at Precinct 8. Gensec have raised a concern, regarding some suspicious activity. I&apos;m sending officers over, just as a precaution.</string>
	 <string id="loc_wwh_01_02">Couldn&apos;t be helped my friends. Just business, you understand yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_73_01">What the hell. They&apos;re deploying tripmines in the parking lot! Deal with it before they close it off.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_09_02">Good, good. Keep bringing them. Be gentle with my little babushkas.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_23_02">Get into the office, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_107_03">That was the last ingredient, time to combine them all. Steady now...</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_87_01">Chopper is on the way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_21_01">Okay, the bridge is turning back. Damn, it&apos;s slow! Just hold off the cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_end_03_02">That&apos;s gonna be worth a fortune! Great job!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_intro_01_02">We&apos;ve got this under control and you&apos;re just going to make the entire job go to kak if you mess with my guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_33_any_02">Keep controlling that room people.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_02_03">It&apos;s a roach motel - only the roaches are Russian mobsters. No matter. Get in there and put them down.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_58a_03">Wow... well. Wait! ... Buluc&apos;s safe.... it has all his contacts and dealings. Good to have if you can crack it open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_56_03">The ship is almost there, gang. Be ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_88_01">Six</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_90_01">That&apos;s the elevator. Let&apos;s go, people! You got military units gathering in the parking lot!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_15_02b">Good! But it will be a long minute!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_09_03">I&apos;m done with the first box.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_04_01">I would do it from here if I could, dear friends, but I can&apos;t. So please open the fucking cargo doors.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_05_02">There should be a laptop somewhere near the house. Plug the USB stick into it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_12_any_02">There we go, off like a prom dress, I&apos;m still working on the paintings.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_53_01">Great, that&apos;s everything, now get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_01_any_01">This is the boat. I see the lights, I&apos;m on my way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_14_04">Cops cut the signal. Get it back up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_17_03">Buluc&apos;s not going to kill himself. Probably. So go open that door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_45_03">You should probably stash that extra loot somewhere safe, so you can take it with you when you leave, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_164_03">We microwave everything so it is as hot and fresh as you can possibly want.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_63_01">We don&apos;t need him to talk, just to hack.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_16_01">Find a ladder. Then you can climb the wagons.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_03d">Wish we had a better idea of exactly what we&apos;re looking for.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_51_any_15">19 bags left!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_24_02">Ah! There it is, but hold up a second. Those tiles are pressure sensitive - stay off of &apos;em. You can use that circuit box to make a safe path across.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_01_03">Holy... that was close! These Russians really don&apos;t want anyone to crash their party. </string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_05_08">Nice of them to leave the place wide open for us. </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_64_05">I know there&apos;s lots of fun stuff in here friends, but you need to aim that cannon!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_cnc_01">Friends, we need to do a bit of an unusual bank robbery, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_18_03">Damn, I&apos;m sure some nosy curtain twitcher heard that!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_57_01">Don&apos;t break his jaw.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_15">Don&apos;t get stuck anywhere, keep moving up! It&apos;ll be worth it, but it&apos;s wasting away quickly!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_cnc_01_01">Gensec are showing their unbreakable vault at the arena. We&apos;re going to use the Alesso concert to prove them wrong.</string>

	 <string id="pln_cr2_26_03">Second. Keep going.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_39_02">Got to be a saw here somewhere. Check the timber logs.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_00_03">That crash probably woke the dead, yeah? Hurry up and get inside that bank.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_18_03">That was a long bekakin&apos; tunnel. Stay quiet and get to it, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_54_01">You got some! Not half bad!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_15_03">Nice going, taking out the cameras.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_53_02">What sort of world do we live in where a rat bastard like that makes demands on honest, upstanding badasses like you. But better do as he asks.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_26_03">Find anything useful nearby to use on the crate?</string>
	 <string id="plt_run_04_03">Clear the pickup zone from cops or I won&apos;t be able to pick you up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_23_01">You gotta get into the office.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_06a_any_04">I&apos;m coming in one minute...</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_88_02">Just a little longer.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_83_03">OK, just one more to go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_21_01">There we go. Is he moving?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_intro_01b">Better you guys than me, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_07_01">My guess would be the crowbars are inside the warehouse.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_06_01">You see that muscle car? That&apos;s Gaddafi&apos;s 1965 original Longfellow. It&apos;s your ride now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_49_03">I got something to show you, boss. You&apos;ll want to see it for yourself.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_115_01">Watch out gang! BFD overheats if you don&apos;t give her enough water. Get it from the bathroom.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_82_02">Found anything yet?</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_20">What the fuck did you guys steal!?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_13_01">That&apos;s it. Hack that terminal.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_43_01">They cut the power! Get it back up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_04_01">Find those transports.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_76_02">Up to the roof and away from the building to the left. Alex has the chopper coming in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_11_02">Good, now use the cameras inside to locate which cell Bain is in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_34_03">Get that body over to the scanner.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_01_01">Benevolent Bank. A Neoclassical beauty. But business calls. We&apos;re going to need some codes, so get to their servers. </string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_intro_01_01">Tickets for Alesso&apos;s show were swapping hands for $400! Whatever happens tonight, someone is getting rich.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_34a_05">Find anything yet for those chains?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_36_any_02">Chopper is on its way. Stay put.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_14_02">Now you have to get inside the auctioneer&apos;s office and get the code. He should be carrying the keycard to it on his person.</string>
	 <string id="loc_wwh_01_03">You&apos;ll hate me for this, but only until you&apos;re dead. Nothing personal!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_e_06">That should get it on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_23_03">Let&apos;s load that cage up, gang. The pilot has a tight schedule.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_07_04">Get those transports opened up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_27_02">That&apos;s it, gang. Only the fourth floor left.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_19_02">Okay, think the bridge is looking good for a drop point.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_12">Woah-woah-woah-woah!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_48_01">Come on, bring the key!</string>

	 <string id="pln_fish_08_02">You got the first stash. Keep looking!</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_05_02">All right, I&apos;m here. Now get the goats in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_13_02">Vlad, smashing malls is one thing. Stealing tiaras is one thing. But nukes!?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_34_any_02">Check all the cases, maybe it&apos;s there.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_07">No-no-no-no-no!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_105_03">The entrance to the PEOC is close to the library. Make your way there, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_09_03">Damn it. Local channels just lit up! Expect company.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_45_03">Now use the keycards on the dock gates. Let the Moretta out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_08_01">There&apos;s valves that control the sprinklers, turn them on!</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_04_08">Argh... You old fart. I&apos;ll kill him first.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_49_03">Get another key!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_63_01">Ach, I&apos;ve got some bad news. They&apos;re shutting down the air space! You gotta get out of there ASAP!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_36_02">My intel didn&apos;t specify exactly where the entrance to the PEOC is. See if you can find something. Turn the room upside down if you have to.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_26_02">Ok, go pick up the C4 and then plant it right above the panic room.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_30_03">So, here&apos;s the thing. It&apos;s out here with me... in my car.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_08_03">Hold on, fellas. Just finding the files for ya.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_00_02">Got your money&apos;s worth out of that vehicle, yeah? Time to go have a look inside the bank. Make it quick, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_05_02">Locke wants us to cut through to the security room. Find it, gang, then approve the sequence</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_25_03">OK, gang, good. Now hold on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_08_02">That&apos;s it for the mobsters, gang. If they&apos;re not all dead, they&apos;re running. Either serves our purpose.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_53_01">It&apos;s hitting the fan! Time for the backup plan.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_47_02">No need to catspaw about now. Get inside!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_95_01">What are you doing? That&apos;s not how you do crowd control!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_01_03">You&apos;re in civvie mode. Your guns and masks are stashed somewhere. Until you get them, you&apos;re invisible to security.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_07_03">Right gate activated. Now find another keycard, and let&apos;s get the other gate open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_89_01">Get the artifact onto the chopper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_21_02">Tonight, we go down in rock and roll history, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_103_07">You&apos;re doing great. Keep everything nice and quiet. </string>

	 <string id="pln_flt_22_02">Good job, gang, now we need the explosives from Bile. Give me a moment. &quot;Bile, it&apos;s time. How soon can you drop off the C4?&quot;</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_11_any_03">We got to go, people!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_07_02">See if you can find anything of interest while waiting for the drill to finish.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_82_01">They interrupted the hacking device. You need to reboot it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_107_01">This is the Right Control Room for the Dock Gate. Use the Keycard here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_18_any_02">Grab it, grab it now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_92_02">Those shutters will not be able to withstand thermite. Get some on there!</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_15_01">Ah, There are my precious things! Hurry, Hurry, take them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_07_03">Okay, I got this one disabled, but there&apos;s still one more to go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_03_03">And that&apos;s the second keycard. Nice job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_09_01">That was the wrong computer. Try another one. Maybe there&apos;s a way to figure out which terminal we need.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_18_03">Almost there... Almost there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_01_01">You see that fence? Cut it open and get inside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_14_01">Hide the meth nearby and then let&apos;s cook another round.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_03_01">(human beat-boxing) Answer. (human beat-boxing) The. (human beat-boxing) the Intercom.</string>

	 <string id="pln_at1_und_04_01">Outstanding work! All four trucks are stopped and ready. Make it rain, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_10_02">Damn, their system didn&apos;t allow us to see who the DNA belongs to. Still, we have a sample of the traitor&apos;s DNA, I&apos;m sure we can put it to good use. Now get back to Hoxton.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_14_04">(drolly) Good job, fuckface. Great fucking job.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_41_02">He really does a good kerel impersonation. Just keep following him.</string>

	 <string id="pln_brn_08_07">One part collected. Get it to the mechanic.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_16">...OK... OK.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_15_01">They&apos;re sending reinforcements.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_01_any_01">Recon the bank. My guy dropped a thermal lance somewhere on the premises... Around the back of the bank, find it.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_06_02">Hey, is everything alright over there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_44_01">Damn! They drove through Wilson&apos;s wall.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_51_04">I need your help to get through. Log on to one of the other computers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_57_01">Yes! Great work. Now stick the C4 into the hole in the safe</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_102_02">OK, it&apos;s drilled all the way through the safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_75_02">Wait. I have his cell number. Let me call him, try and distract him. Get ready to fill his glass.</string>

	 <string id="vld_fex_57_04">Use your guns! Put him in the ocean to drown!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_03_02">This is the warehouse. You can bet the better loot is right here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_53_04">I hear they make a lot of meth here. I don&apos;t want to put ideas in your head, but if you want to make a little extra money...</string>

	 <string id="loc_skm_01_03">Great, we got our quarry. Make sure the chop stays secure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_45_02">Put all the loot you find somewhere close, so you can collect it later, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_18_01">Hey, where you going? Back in the car!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_depositbox_stage1_intro_a_01">OK guys I want this to be a homerun. First get the thermal drill from the parking lot. Then head in to hit the vault. Watch for guards and cameras. </string>

	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_03">Thanks. I hated that poes. Kept stealing my shampoo.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_11_02">Time to go. No time for lock-picking, just shoot off the door handle.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_21_02">Okay, now you gotta use the first card in the security room, and then you gotta be quick to swipe the second on the panel by the vault door. </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_12_02">Did you search everywhere?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_51_01">Guys, you need to get out of there so the cops will follow you.</string>

	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_21">I&apos;ve got bad fucking news, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_30_01">We can get the ammo out, but only when the turret pieces are safely gathered in. Hide that ammo for now.</string>

	 <string id="bot_gen_06b_any_03">... time to get ready!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_61_03">Oh, looks like they&apos;ve got a nice weapons lab! They&apos;ve got one of the cases in an adjacent storage room, so get over there, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_08_02">Another guard up ahead. Stay in the shadows.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_43_03">Alright, let&apos;s do the other thing then. Play it loud, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_intro_01">Okay, stay low everybody. Detonating in four, three, two, cover...</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_07_01">Alright, I&apos;d say it&apos;s time to get blastin&apos;. Put your masks on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_99_04">Get him the car key so you can get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_17_06">How it got up there is a mystery.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_21_02">Can&apos;t do anything until those drills are working.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_intro1_02">Bain left me instructions just in case something went wrong. I&apos;ve double-checked and the warehouse meeting spot still looks quiet, for the time being. Hole up there while I try to find out what&apos;s going on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_18_01">Come on, what&apos;s fucking wrong with you. Those bundles can&apos;t have gone too far.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_82_01">The code should have a one at the beginning.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_04b_any_04">... I&apos;m going as fast as I can!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_40_03">That chute there can transport the loot to the lobby. Might speed things up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_16_01">OK, get into that tunnel. Time for a visit to Mexico.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_38_01">That was crazy! That just blew the dust of the shelves even where I&apos;m sitting!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_49_08">Bag and secure. You know the routine.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_28_03">Plant that C4 around the glass dome.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_08_01">Is there a problem over there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_20_01">Find the bags for the cage, and get them to the parking lot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_44_02">There&apos;s a bunch of rooms in the maintenance tunnels. Check all of them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_23_02">Add some more paintings. A few more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_02_02">You know how this goes. Eyes peeled for security. Civvies need to be controlled. And keycards are always useful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_27_01">Damn, there&apos;s the alarm. They&apos;re on to us. Get the saw ready.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_61_03">Keep those kerels occupied until the escape vehicle arrives, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_56_02">The evidence lockup should be on the second floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_35_02">All right! Find the garden hose!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_17_02">She&apos;s moving. But not fast. This will take some time. Stay hidden, guys. Lie low. Or, if you want, look around for extra loot.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_06a_any_03">Arriving in one minute...</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_42_01">Over here, please.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_02b">Everything a child of the 1980s dreams of. Including the nightmares, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="plt_flt_07_02">Jesus, there&apos;s too many cops on the scene! I can&apos;t get close enough, so you need to deal with it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_74_01">It&apos;s somewhere on the ground floor!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_18_03">You have impressed me, Dallas. Two years hasn&apos;t slowed you down a bit. Now, get out there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_26_02">Dammit! The plane missed the cable. Alright. Still time for another pass. Stand by.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_22_03">Time to get into that office. Stay low.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_49_02">You got metal security doors blocking the storage room. I can unlock them remotely if you hack their control boxes.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_02_03a">Vlad&apos;s fury is like a... like a... like a big fucking nuke drops on your head.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_29_03">Come on. Just stick the thermal paste on the grate and burn through. It&apos;s not hard.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_end_03">Thank you, my friends. I will not forget this day.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_23_03">That safe path won&apos;t last forever, gang. Make sure you make the most of it. You can create it again, though.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_76_01">Can&apos;t get out of there on an empty tank. Fuel the plane!</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_cnc_01_03">There&apos;s something at the Murkywater warehouse, down by the river. Something I would like.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_13_03">So far so good. Don&apos;t screw it up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_11_any_01">OK, that&apos;s all we need.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_102_01">Blerrie, wrong code! Now you gotta wait until it resets!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_26_02">The code should be on the screen. Get it, and go open the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_28_01">Nicely done, friends! A job well done. We probably even emptied the Mayor&apos;s personal bank account this time!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_78_04">That scythe should be useful</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_09_03">Smoke? The wheel stopped on smoke?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_53_04">Yeah, the safe is here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_cnc_02">Looks like we&apos;ve got a jewelry store that could use a little lightening. Call me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_15_03">Keep an eye out for the chopper.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_33_01">Maybe if I hack into the system and get it to ping the right workstation. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_35_01">See if you can find something related to Garrett&apos;s wife.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_77_03">Keep looking for that code, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_25_01">Guys, you&apos;re not on a date. Quit strolling and get hustling. Move it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_106_02">The balloon needs to be sent up. Do it when you&apos;re ready to get the money out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_02_any_01">OK guys, search the place. I know the address is there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_61_01">That offshore account is your exit fund. When you skip town you&apos;ll be glad you put it right there. </string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_09_01">I&apos;ll count down the time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_56_02">BFD is a greedy girl. Needs a lot of power. Hook her up to two sockets. You can find them inside the casino. And keep the cops off.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_38_02">Let me see, one, two. Yes, all here! Now, please use the cables to join me up here. </string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_05_any_02">That&apos;s 30 seconds till the van leaves.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_13_any_02">One down!</string>
	 <string id="elp_framing_brf_speak_03b">Find a way to sneak into his apartment, steal the gold and plant incriminating evidence against him. Then leave undetected.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_12_01">Here&apos;s the ladder. You can use it to get on top of the wagons.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_63_02">OK, it&apos;s done. Go have a look at the patient.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_25_04">Come on, you need to hustle it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_23_02">Ah we&apos;re made. We go to plan B! Lock it down and get the stuff done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_07_any_04">Ah, we should have sneaked this. Tons of gold in this deal.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_54_03">An FBI connection of mine has rigged the place with spy cameras and has set up surveillance drones outside. You can control them from the gadget on the roof.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_70_03">Cover is blown friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_02">...I... think.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_04_03">I&apos;m betting the keys are locked away somewhere. Find the storage.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_33_03">Not long now friends. Train will be there in half a minute.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_71_01">Keep an eye on the sprinklers, we don&apos;t want the kerels to set them off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_51_any_05">We&apos;re going to be done soon - I hope.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_28_any_03">We are doing good - keep away from the guards.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_05_03">Woah, didn&apos;t take long for the SWAT&apos;s to show up. Must&apos;ve been en route.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_08_02">Okay guys, keep it together. Get him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_91_05">Throw those cases into the helicopter before getting in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_15_03">There has to be a way to destroy the evidence here in the station!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_11_any_02">Shit! Bikers are on your case.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_02_05">Let&apos;s go! Let&apos;s go! We can all fit in the elevator.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_26">God damnit!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_70_01">Okay, the electricity is back, now just start the printer again</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_24">We got a fucking police caravan on our ass!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_14_03">Sold out? Fuck, someone just got a great deal on a pound of coke.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_68_02">All right. They&apos;re blind in the front and upstairs. Good work. Only a few in the vault area left.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_12_any_01">They are coming from the railway bridge! Watch out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_97_02">Charge up the cannon again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_03_03">Great, two keycards. That&apos;s what we need. Get to work and open that vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_18_03">Light up those tires, gang. Find some gas and get it on them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_02_02">Get out of there! Into the cargo hold!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58h_03">Ignite the can and push that thing out of there towards the SWAT van!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_02_02">Okay, the Fed&apos;s won&apos;t be long, so time to hit it hard and fast. Find the C4 in the guard room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_43_02">Get the power back up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_34_01">Damn swat-van is blocking the route! Move it! </string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_brief_01">This is the place, people... This bank here holds all the Mendoza capital north of the border.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_22_04">Good, now watch it cook!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_51_02">Nice! Dock is opening. Next step: get the Moretta moving to her berth. I need to talk to her directly. Find me the comm frequency - most likely on a computer in the offices there. Find it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_04_05">Your dicks ain&apos;t for holding. They&apos;re for fucking. And there&apos;s a lot of Murkies up there waiting for it. Apologies to any ladies in the crew.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_41_03">Just keep following our friend.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_101_02">Should be clear soon.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_71_04">Watch the sprinkler system!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_86_06">Stop those guns so that I can bring in Bile!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_21_03">Hurry now, get a drill on that door.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_12_01">And....got it. I got it! I can&apos;t believe I got it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_24_02">There&apos;s gotta be something on one of those laptops.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_23_03">Keep looking for the armory.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_06_05">Someone better fucking explain this shit to me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_10_any_01">Next up, the computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_20_03">Ah! Cops have turned the bridge! All right, one of you get into that control room and turn it back. We need to get on the other side!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_47_02">Enter the room right above the vault and pour out the thermite.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_25_03">Keep looking. The clues you need can be in any of the three sanctum rooms.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_100_01">Try another key!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_95_03">To the boat, gang. Come on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_91_01">You need to clear the area outside the bank.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_27_02">Thank you, sir. God bless the FBI.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_01c">Right. I&apos;ll take the first, but you can keep the glory.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_67_03">Hajrudin you dwankie chop! What took you so long? Ok friends, get to the car.</string>
	 <string id="btf_cs1_01_03">I&apos;m sorry you feel that way, ma&apos;am.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_44_03">Have you checked all the rooms in the maintenance tunnels?</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_02_03">Don&apos;t mind that, it&apos;s my police scanner. There&apos;s no cops here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_19_any_01">Good, OK, you can open the vault now. I have turned on the vault&apos;s camera feed as well.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_12_01">Right, now you gotta find Garrett&apos;s office.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_68_01">Great, you&apos;ve disabled all cameras in the front and upstairs. Just a few in the vault area.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_11_03">There&apos;s only one place I can sell that. Marrakech.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_06_01">Get the bags up to Locke as soon as you can, crew. Look for the large vertical shaft around there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_12_06">Move to the next building. Come on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_06_03">I&apos;ll have the system down in a bit.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_40_02">Time to defend, gang! Bile&apos;s on his way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_31_01">Attach those winches now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_25_any_02">Server room - find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_44_01">Alright. Now hook me up to that terminal again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_63_03">Blerrie, they&apos;re closing the air space around the White House. You gotta go now! Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_07a_any_02">30 seconds, guys...</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_42_03">We need to get to the transfer room on the ground floor, but we need the Taxman and the server with us.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_11_01">Great, that should do it. Now try starting the computer again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_18_03">Have a proper look around, don&apos;t miss out on any ingredients.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_10_any_01">Those pictures might help us later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_11_01">Okay. When you&apos;re ready, raise the balloon and the pilot will collect the cage.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_04_any_02">Got a minute till the van leaves - with or without you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_park_suggest_park_03">The park should offer a good defensive position.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_07_02">Okay, hacking the system now...</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_52_02">Keycards can disable the lasers. Keep an eye out for any.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_24_01">It seems the armory has a different access level. You&apos;ll need to recode the key tag again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_36_02">Ok, that&apos;s enough for now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_16_01">Bastards called in a SHIELD! Try and flank him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_26_03">There must be something we can use to get past the vault security system.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_04_02">They probably keep the evidence files in the chief&apos;s computer. Try the upper floor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_07_02">Right friends, better go out and get Mr Pink, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_19_01">Holy.... I count nine guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_31_03">The center one!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_07_01">Look in through the windows and try to find the alarm box. You&apos;ll have a limited time to disable it once you&apos;re inside, so it&apos;s best to be prepared.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_03_02">We can&apos;t get in without a keycard. We need to find one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_11_02">Perfect! They won&apos;t be able to use that anymore.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_58_02">Careful with the head!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_intro_01_02">Commissar&apos;s men will be on edge after what you did at the motel. Still, this should come as a surprise. Get your masks on, and put that rat down.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_09">Stay! Heel! </string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_46_01">That&apos;s probably worth a small fortune.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_93_01">Guys! The chopper! </string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_18_03">And... storage room is open. The keys are ready for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_101_01">Set up a zipline to speed things up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_38_04">No time to waste, civvies could find you soon. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_intro_a_04">This is gonna be easy as long as you steer clear of the security systems and guards. Well maybe not so easy. Take the paintings with red sold stickers and clear out. We need four at least.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_34_02">Easy enough. I got the next one too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_16_01">Getting the money is fine, but your priority has to be assembling the skyhook. Look for the pieces of the cage and get it built.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_22_01">That&apos;s great, pile them up there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_03_01">Look out the window - Taxman is the guy in the white shirt.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_75_03">No need to stay there any longer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_21_07">Oh man, sounds like a hell of a gig in there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_72_01">OK, so much for pussyfooting around. Time for action!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_10_01">All right. Now slap the C4 on there. We&apos;re busting our way out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_67_03">Start searching for the Murkywater nest egg we&apos;re after. It&apos;s in the form of weapons.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_23_02">People would pay a fortune just to look upon that armor. And it&apos;s yours. </string>
	 <string id="rb22_sah_intro_04a">I have an odd feeling about this one. Like it&apos;s... somehow personal.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_19">Your adventure is over, you goat-fuck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_44_any_04">OK! OK, it&apos;s empty. Just keep looking!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_08_any_02">Get me a computer. I need to tap into their system.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_c1_01">Caustic soda.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_10_03">That&apos;s it! Now get the Jewels with the cocaine!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_17_03">Not much further now. Get him up the tower on the right!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_24_any_09">Fuck me, we needed those damn cooks. I&apos;m going with caustic soda.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_11_02">Everyone on the ground, sound as a pound? Great. Now look around for the first money pallet. When you find &apos;it, pop a flare and I&apos;ll be right over.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_45_03">Now, give me a few moments, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_14_any_01">Use the codes to defuse the C4!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_99_02">However, it doesn&apos;t run well on batteries, so you gotta plug it into a proper socket.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_19_01">OK now, they probably keep it in a safe. Find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_58_03">Now drop the C4 in. Detonate it and the pressure inside will blow it wide open...</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_16_02">Man, the city&apos;s a ruin. Roads, buildings...everything&apos;s screwed.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_05_01">If you would be so kind as to collect the articles I have left for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_cash_brf_speak_04">A little cash goes a long way. The local Harvest &amp; Trustee branch bank needs to be lightened of its load.  Let&apos;s do this bank hit, get their vault open, and fill our pockets a little. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_33_01">Careful, looks like the bags are gonna explode!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_46_01">See if you can find a crowbar.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_02_02">Hey! Put the groupie down, and get on the Intercom!.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_32_01">Drive through the hole on the street!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_intro_01_01">OK, we&apos;re here. Time to go to work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_63_01">Fire in the hole!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_20_any_01">Nope... This isn&apos;t working either.  Get me another one, I&apos;ll be there in a sec.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_15_07">Get the target to the tower!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_01_01">There it is. Do your thing, guys, but Gage prefers you do it quietly. Front gate is dead ahead, but maybe you can find alternative routes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_02_02">The shooting&apos;s bound to draw the cops. We need to get the goats away.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_09_any_01">I&apos;m coming in - don&apos;t know what dock though!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_50_02">Okay, the blimp is on the way. Just give it time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_50_any_02">Blackhawk! Blackhawk coming down! Gun up team!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_07_03">No, wait!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_13_02">Two card reader with a 10 second time lock? You can bet they&apos;re holding some serious hardware in that vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_90_01">Eight</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_05_03">Soooo the wheel stopped on sniper... </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_110_01">This is the workers&apos; locker room. Check for a keycard here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_intro_01_03">This is the one. Biggest bank job yet. Everything has been training for this moment. You know what to do.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_02_01">Find Locke&apos;s crates, gang. Look for the ones with the strobe on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_64_06">C&apos;mon friends, turn that dinges.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_06_01">All right, give me some time to hack the system.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_76_03">Don&apos;t think that rug should be there. Likely hiding a hatch. Remember the room - we&apos;ll come back here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_04_02">You need to act like you&apos;re there to go through with the drug deal.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_01_01">Okay. Well, you heard the man. The product is IN the goats, and the goats are all over downtown. Round &apos;em up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_97_03">Jäger Mark II safes are among the worst. Can&apos;t blow them up, can&apos;t use just any drill on them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_35_02">Look around the warehouses for a can of fuel.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_09_01">Smoke?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_68_02">Okay, now I need a guest list. Find out who&apos;s in that room. We&apos;ll need their key. Reception should have a terminal with that info. Grab a USB stick.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_28_01">Management Office, they always have portable computers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_53_01">Bile managed to drop some explosives for you. They should be near where you landed, so grab &apos;em.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_15_01">Well, that&apos;s quite a mess all right. Now get these bodies out of sight.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_18_01b">They got me. But it&apos;s ok, just a minor flesh wound.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_28_02">See if someone in Management forgot their computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_01_01">Alright. First goal - get inside. Front door&apos;s right ahead, but maybe show a little guile and look for other ways in. </string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_01_03">One minute...almost there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_90_01">The code should have a nine at the beginning.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_06_any_02">OK, that&apos;s all I can take.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_63_02">The garbage truck is waiting in the garage for the money bags. Get down there, get it secured!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_15_any_05">It&apos;s open! Bag the gold!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_05_02">The customer is about a minute away.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_61_01">Russian chopper pulling out. </string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_24">This didn&apos;t go as planned, guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_48_03">He might leave if we turn off the lights. Do you see a circuit box nearby?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_85_04">Are you having trouble getting the Beast to run?</string>
	 <string id="sys_hb2_09_01">Evidence locker access granted.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_21_02">Ha, it worked! For once, TV is good for something, yeah? Now, use it to get past security. </string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_12">We got a tail - and they&apos;re getting closer!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_30_02">Our Insider can show you the way out. Find her.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_intro_03">Ready everyone.... here goes... fire in the hole...  </string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_gold_stage1_brief_02">Gold is golden. You&apos;re going to work hard on this one. Get into the bank, control the room, open that bank vault with the thermal drill... I&apos;ll try to have my guy drop it off for you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_65_03">Right friends, move it! Your ride is there. Chop chop.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_63_03">Almost feel sorry for the chop. He&apos;ll be gone for a good while now, no need to worry.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_57_01">Now keep it clear of dwankies.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_04_01">Quick! Answer his pager and make some crap up.</string>
	 <string id="btm_cs1_01_06">Would you like a zipbag for that, sir? Only a dollar fifty.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_24_01">Clear the area from cops so Bile can come in and pick you up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_21_02">Damn, the door must be locked from the outside. Maybe there&apos;s another way out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_34_02">Okay, that must be one of the test subjects. Get the body to the scanner so we can get the information we need.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_04_02">Get hauling those tablets to the mixer. </string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_end_b_01b">Good work people. This could have gone poorly but you managed to keep us in the black. Arms trading, anyone?</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_09a_02">This guy has a sick sense of humor. Thinks making puzzles to open doors is good for stopping thieves.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_47_01">If you need more supplies, there should still be more outside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_23_05">The armory. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_39_02">Nice and easy. Just walk out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_01_01">Damn, look at this place. This guy rides in style. You can do this quietly or with a bang, it&apos;s your choice.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_70_02">Shoot that cannon, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_22_02">This is going to be a monster!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_14_01">Gang! Get out of there! What the hell are you doing?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_55_any_01">I&apos;m getting nervous, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_77_02">C4 is waiting for you. What are you waiting for?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_61_02">You can&apos;t get the code without any juice. Get the power turned on again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_09_any_01">OK, that&apos;s enough, get the recording and lets get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_59_01">I think that&apos;s enough evidence to kill their case against us, but I won&apos;t object if you get more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_10_02">You got the third stash. One more now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_38_03">Did you see that? That&apos;s how we do things.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_16_01">There we go.</string>
	 <string id="plt_mad_04_01">I see that you have disabled the guns! Hold on, I&apos;m coming with the EMP.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_51_01">Since you took care of the outer panic room door, the lance won&apos;t need as long. At least there&apos;s that!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_22_03">The crane can lift the firetrap container. Look for the controls.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_79_02">Won&apos;t take long to squeeze this guy for the code. Hang tight.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_120_03">Just... a little... longer.....</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_04_any_01">That door looks like it&apos;s made of balsa, shoot the lock of that thing.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_02_any_01">I&apos;ll be there in two minutes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_87_02">Keep the police away from the drill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_117_01">Guys, hurry up! He&apos;s gonna sound the alarm in thirty seconds.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_12_02">I&apos;ve learned that Buluc has four personal guards that seem to pass the keycard to this door between them. Maybe they wrote down who has it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_40_01">Ah! Gentlemen! Greetings!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_10_03">Hey, he dropped a keycard. Not for the storage room, that&apos;d be too easy. Head to his office.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_21_01">Now, pick up the money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_end_01_02">That&apos;s how the pro&apos;s do it! Awesome work gentlemen!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_49_01">The hack was interrupted. Get it going again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_06_03">Good job. Look around and see if you can find the EMP parts.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_59_04">The drill stopped!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_20_01">Great the timer is done! Grab the keycard!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_10_02">There we go, friends. That&apos;s a good spot to cut through.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_53_03">Yes, it would be most agreeable to get some fuel in this chopper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_can_01_01">Kill every one of those thugs, gang.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_19_01">More coppers are going to arrive unless you shut that alarm off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_79_02">They say crap rolls downhill but here it&apos;s flows everywhere. This is a goddamn maze.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_04_04">...caustic soda?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_12_any_03">SWATs incoming from the lumber mill, keep them away!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_10_02">Dallas! There&apos;s a security guard outside and he&apos;s gonna see the broken camera. Take him out before he calls it in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_f_01">Strike that...</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_16_02">Don&apos;t be shy now. Into the complex!</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_07_05">So what&apos;s it like in DC? All those scumbag politicians on the payroll keep the cops off your asses?</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_11_01">Whoah, that&apos;s a big toothbrush... I want it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_overpass_swat_heli_incoming_02">SWAT helicopter incoming. Get ready to face some heavy firepower.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_82_02">Hurry, friends! Get to the plane.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_35_02">Ok, I&apos;ll set these off remotely. You focus on the cars.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_23_03">Return to the security gate and melt those bars. It should work.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_32_02">Good! You found him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_51_any_07">Christ... Is it buffering? Go faster! Why don&apos;t they have Google fiber... Goddam American broadband.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_08_02">Maybe try that thermite you found before.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_end_02_01">Let&apos;s talk numbers. Thirteen managers over two hundred years, with millions of customers, moving trillions of dollars. And one heist by four badass gangsters.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_46_any_02">OK, you delivered! Now let me get you out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_31_any_01">Cops all over the street!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_31_any_01">There&apos;s a car waiting for you, just across the road.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_intro_a_01">Pier 39. Tag the truck carrying the voting machines to Washington, and get back here. Let me stress, we&apos;re only here for the truck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_13_any_03">Get the money and clear out ASAP!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_58_02">Come on, check those containers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_end_a_01">Good work getting the meth out. That was not exactly an easy gig. I&apos;m sure whoever ratted out the lab is going to get Hector&apos;s full attention. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_20_any_03">OK, so add caustic... No, wait, add acid - muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_01_01">Ok, keep our little V.I.P. dwankie safe and out of trouble.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_108_02">Blerrie! Didn&apos;t work. You must have gotten something wrong. Wait a bit and try again, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_23_01">...it&apos;s waiting for you in a dumpster out by the parking lot.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_60_04">Still gotta get your hands on the card.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_09_01">Okay, now you need to smash up that meth. Get wrecking, crew!</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_06_any_01">So that&apos;s 6 paintings.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_63_03">BFD did a great job. Down into the vault. gang.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_01f">Okay, going in.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_01_09">I&apos;m smoking anywhere I want!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_35_01">The place is starting to fall apart, get out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_19_01">You&apos;re looking for two keycards. Look around the desks, offices.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_37_02">Now get to that same zip-line to get your good selves out of there. </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_101_03">The chopper can&apos;t land until you take out those turrets. Find the control boxes and disconnect them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_44_04">Don&apos;t be afraid to pick it up...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_72_06">Restart the charge cycle.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_18_03">This one will be down by the silo, y&apos;hear?</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_07_any_01">I just saw someone escape. Get ready for trouble.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_29_any_01">They locked down the building!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_03_04">Walls and router boxes. They go together like trouble and badges.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb2_03_02">Get in. We should coast home in this!</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_02_03">Yes. The vault! This is good. This is very good!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_52_02">How are you coming along with that floor?</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_01_08">I remember when you could smoke in the operating room. Once I put on that damn dress I tell ya...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_41_05">Have you got the ark open, yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_26_01">Don&apos;t kill any hostages! We want to do this low-key.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_59_01">Damn, no need to be quiet any longer. Time for a new plan.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_56_03">Right in the kisser! </string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_16_03">That&apos;s it for the gas! Get back in there! Get back to work.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_16_01b">I think it&apos;s time we leave, don&apos;t you?</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_cnc_02">Office parties all over the capitol will be duller affairs if Uncle Vlad can&apos;t supply the Christmas &quot;cheer&quot;. You can help.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_25_02">Boom! I caught it!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_22_06b">God dammit, people! Cover me!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_69_01">Set up a flare!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_17">No-no-no-no-no!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_84_03">Blind here til you get that terminal back on, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_23_03">Damn! Okay, just try again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_87_03">The code begins with a six, according to my source.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_15">Half the fucking police force is on our ass!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_09_03">That they do, but we aren&apos;t letting that stop us, are we?</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_19_11">The Payday Gang is here to help me! You should run!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_78_02">You&apos;ve got to get those screws off as well, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_24_02">You got the package, now stash it in the tree.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_intro_a_01">Everyone&apos;s here, good. The villa&apos;s on the other side of the airstrip. Sneak in there, find the lab. when you&apos;ve found the engine,  hustle it back to this airfield and wait for pick-up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_01_to_departure_van">The van leaves in one minute. Wrap it up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_06_03">The hacking has been stopped. Get it up and running again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_67_02">Elevators are headed to your floor. Keep an eye on that.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_17_03b">You guys got me covered, right?</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_17_03">Good, you got your hands on a blowtorch. Nothing stopping us from getting through that door now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_132_02">Stay sharp, friends! They&apos;ve activated a defence turret!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_11_any_03">Get the cooking going - we can&apos;t stay here - at all in fact!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_04_02">Hey, Hey, HEY. Don&apos;t you wave this off. Bain and Vlad have a long history together. I care about this shit.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_49_02">The call came from Shaw, which means the Commissar is somewhere there. Look for a clue for Shaw.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_46_any_02">Good work! The metal detector is off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_43_02">Alright, minds back on the job. The house is littered with evidence that could still screw us. Deal with it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_32_03">Use the conveyor in the central hub to ferry the box.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_107_01">Don&apos;t forget the cooler!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_17_03">Hmm... Sosa&apos;s office seems to be locked up behind a separate security system.... hang on...</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_56_01">Let me handle this, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_06_01">Find that whiteboard, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_26_01">Good job, guys. That should get rid of the gas in the scanning room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_80_01">Rey&apos;s Pizza, what can I get you?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_37_01">See if you can find a way into that area.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_10_any_01">The car will pick you up around the corner.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_depositbox_a_intro_a_04">We might have a very valuable object in this bank. I have insurance papers backing that up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_93_03">Dangerous to stick around there, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_98_04">We need to get the cannon charged.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_15_02">Guys, grab the C4 from the van. Get it on the street.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_41_01">That&apos;s the head of security. He seems to be at the dock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_33_02">Get that limo!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_22_01">He&apos;s en route now with C4. Just hang in there, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_49_06">Got some new guns in, boss. You wanna see them?</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_48_any_01">So I&apos;m going to send this feed live to all the media outlets as you&apos;re uploading. They&apos;re gonna eat this up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_17_02">Set up the buzzsaws. Two on the sides of the panic room and two on the floor below.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_06_03">Remember: the mechanic said something about a bunker, and that you would find a seat for the bike there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_01_01">Hurry, guys! Into the hold!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_79_03">Time to disconnect the hose, the plane is all full.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_07_02">Crew, you need to deal with the metal detectors. They use a lot of electricity so find and shut down the circuit boxes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_08_01">You need to patch me in so I can open those doors.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_52_02">Nicely done!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_59_01">Move the van out of the way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_02_02">We probably need to enter the prison...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_10_01">That&apos;s the third stash. Only one left!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_22_01">Keep tabs on those hostages, they can still sound the alarm!</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_14_07">And another fuck up. At least you&apos;re consistent.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_10_01">He&apos;s got a keycard. It&apos;s not for the storage room,so likely for his office. See what&apos;s in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_32_01">Mercy Hospital, please hold... Ok, now how can I help?</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_20_01">I&apos;ve made arrangements to drop off some equipment for you, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_30_03">It&apos;s another grate, but that&apos;s fine. Use another batch of thermal paste.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_55_03">Hello, what&apos;s this? Server room? Find an IT person and make them override the lock for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_01_02">Jump out like a jack-in-the-box. Masks on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_72_03">Go find Ralph Garnet and take that keycard from his priviledged-ass-self.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_49_01">The storage room is blocked off with sturdy metal doors, yeah? If you find and tap me into the security boxes, I can unlock them from here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_48_03">Get out of there! Run!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_06_01">Remember: you need to find crowbars and jam them into the vault&apos;s fans. They are most likely inside the warehouse.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_09_02">Those are all the bags we need but you guys know the drill, if you want more - stay and get more!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_par_03_01">Holy crap! We knocked all three trucks off the road. Make it count!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_101_01">Use that blowtorch you got a while back, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_67_03">You gotta get a drill on that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_62_03">Through the hole, gang! You&apos;re getting out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_end_a_02">Cops bloodied our nose on that one - somehow I think Vlad was holding back information... As usual. But you did well... Let&apos;s see what old Vlad tells us. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_47_01">OK, time to get the hell out of here. Go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_69_04">Stop the cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_intro_06">OK, time for a jewelry hit. We need at least ten bags. That&apos;s kinda crazy - but you guys are good at crazy!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_111_03">Plane got the cage, but it was empty. Damn! Alright, no matter. Carry the bags out instead.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_27_01">OK, position looks good. Drop it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_35_02">Moretta&apos;s at the berth. Time for a hostile boarding.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_02_02">Check the arena for closets marked with the red X. That&apos;s where the Inside Man has stashed the C4</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_92_01">You need to help him get through the door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_01_any_01">This is an FBI branch office so you really, really, really want to be quiet. We&apos;re in the lion&apos;s den. First step, get inside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_25_03">Take care of those Murkys and I&apos;ll get Bain to safety!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_62_01">Dompkops! You weren&apos;t supposed to kill him!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_78_03">You have to protect the door while it&apos;s being hacked!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_34_03">I&apos;m sure glad most of the party is upstairs so we can work in peace and quiet down here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_03_01">First, hit the switch to open the cargo doors!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_19_02">You need a couple of keycards. Look around.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_89_01">The code should have an eight at the beginning.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_15_any_02">FBI is swarming guys - get that door open!</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_04_02">Goddamn it Locke, I&apos;m gonna smack you for this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_35_02">That looks like a television news crew. You don&apos;t want to be on TV guys, stay off their camera.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_23_any_01">There you go.  Now let&apos;s frame this guy, get up to the roof, and our guy will throw you the coke.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_78_03">Good, now just wait a minute...</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_02_01">Rust told me the bikers have one of the cars in the front where they guard the stuff we&apos;re after. Make your way there and don&apos;t let anything stop you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_28_02">Operate the crane, guys. Get that piggy into position.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_32_any_05">I hate to see all that gold go to waste!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_16_02">The chopper just dropped off the drill, gang. You need to fetch it and get it to those vaults.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_01_any_01">Alright, get to the house and find the address, be careful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_10_02">We&apos;ll send these Russians to hell. And their cars. There&apos;s a gas station nearby. See if you can find something to help the fire.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_34_01">Now get the hell out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_29_02">There you go! Hurry over to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_41_03">The symbols, friends. They&apos;re the key.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_18_01">There&apos;s a yellow waste chute hanging on the side of the construction tower. If you throw the loot in there I&apos;ll have someone pick it up later.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_03d">Hey, I just thought of something. Should we maybe have brought hazmat suits?</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_28_02">Get back to the train and use the hard drive. I should be able to override the security.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_08_01">Once you start, you&apos;ll only have a few seconds to take out all the cameras.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_118_02">Fish in this town grow fat on corpses.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_45_03">Have you checked between the actual trains?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_62_03">Chopper&apos;s back in the area. Watch for it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_27_02">That&apos;s the turret ammo. We can take that later, but keep after the turret.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_77_04">The hacking was interrupted!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_25_02">Hey! Don&apos;t forget to strap the fucking money to the chopper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_08w_02">Get ready for the eighth wave!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_75_02">Why are you still there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_03_03">We better follow Locke&apos;s directions on this one. Take the charges to the door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_112_03">You need to haul those bags out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_cbf_01_01">Trick or treat, smell my feet. Give me something to put on the street. If you don&apos;t, I don&apos;t care. Just don&apos;t cook in your underwear.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_32_01">There&apos;s the boat. Hop in, my good friends! Let us take her for gentle cruise.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_71_01">Remember: you&apos;re looking for a clue about Downtown Washington. A file, hint - anything. See where he is at.</string>
	 <string id="sys_hb2_01_01">Incoming security clearance request.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_04_any_02">OK, shit just got real. Run for the server guys. Rip it out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_04_07">Probably caustic soda.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_04_any_03">That&apos;s it. Open it up and let&apos;s see what we got.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_14_02">He&apos;s dropping the pieces of the skyhook. Assemble them, and send up the balloon. The pilot will do the rest.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_07_01">Alright. That looks good. Thanks.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_54_01">Ah kak, they know we&apos;re trying to fuck off. They&apos;re going all in! Hold steady, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_06_02">Alright then. Hmm... it says there&apos;s also physical evidence.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_50_03">I can&apos;t get in. You gotta get me through the firewall using another computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_13_01">Put out those fires with the sprinkler system.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_76_03">Those lights are part of the locking mechanism.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_41_01">Great! Power is back. Get the scanner working again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_67_03">Perfect! Now gimme a second...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_13_any_01">They&apos;re in the house!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_gold_brf_speak_01">You can&apos;t go wrong with gold. The Harvest &amp; Trustee bank is trying to up its liquidity with a large deposit. It&apos;s something we should take advantage of, don&apos;t you think?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_80_02">You need to swipe Ralph&apos;s card before the code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_15_01">Third one found.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_121_01">Amazing job! Now, climb up on top of BFD  and the blimp will take you to safety. Or grab more loot. Your choice.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_50_02">That nice marble floor has got to have a big hole blown into it. Our prize is right under there, friends. </string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_02_02">Get in and look for the Murkywater trains. You should be able to spot them fairly easy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_18_02">You got thirty seconds to make it out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_62_01">Chopper&apos;s back on the scene! Watch out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_71_02">Blerrie, the charging has stopped. Start it up again, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_02_02">There&apos;s our guy. He&apos;s shit faced! Get him away from there. There&apos;s a deserted lumber yard near your position.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_104_02">It&apos;s nothing my crew can&apos;t handle, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fourstores_stage1_brief_01b">This is a good start... Just stay frosty until things heat up...</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_01_01">Is this on? Hello...where are those fucking clow - oh, there you are!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_06_02">Okay gang - now get out there and assemble the cage!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_13_07">Fingers crossed this is the one</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_02">I should really read up on this stuff, shouldn&apos;t I?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_71_03">Still in whisper mode. Good, good. Now find the computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_56_03">Think the drill is finished, guys. Time to get into that basement.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_22_any_01">I&apos;m off in 30!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_09">...that&apos;s my very best guess.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_21">What a mompie. He&apos;s better dead.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_36_01">OK, that&apos;s it! Now back away, this place&apos;s about to blow!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_06_01">Damn, they rigged the boxes with C4! Defuse them! </string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_92_02">Second digit for the vault. Just the last to find.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_19">These fuckers went to driving school - I&apos;ll tell you that much!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_22_03">Now let&apos;s enter the prison. Use the keycard to open the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_141_02">Let&apos;s get the hell out of here, friends! We&apos;ve already overstayed our welcome.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_06_01">Should be two access points around there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_08_any_01">20 thousand.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_15_05">Blerrie, you&apos;re going to have more guards to deal with shortly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_20_02">The saws are done. Good job.</string>
	 <string id="crn_man_01_01">Like a glove.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_17_03">Light up those tires, gang. Get some gas on them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_49_03">Hurry and get one of those gates open, chop chop.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_81_03">Take those equipment bags and set the Beast up for action!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_79_01">Dammit! Gas! Gas!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_40_01a">Is that crest... Romanov?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_133_02">Several defense turrets just came online!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_49_03">No question, Bain sent us to the right bank, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_17_01">We&apos;re in, but you still got to deal with the deposit boxes. You got to get three bags back to the pick-up. Hustle!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_159_04">A very good evening to you, sir.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_end_02_02">Shame you guys couldn&apos;t keep it stealthy. Not a day for achievements.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_68_01">OK guys I&apos;m back on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_41_04">You need to restart the winch, friends! </string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_end_a_02b">Well executed. Guns destroyed and Hector is informed. Let&apos;s cash in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_12_03">Get that gate open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_102_02">Screw the alarms, guys. Just grab The Dentists&apos; loot and we can be done.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_58_04">Alright! The drill should open that door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_08_03">Don&apos;t let him get away!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_09_02">Did the rat jump off...? No. Can&apos;t be.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_22_03">Now swipe the vault keypanel! Come on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_10_01">Get inside the mansion, move!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_120_03">Pigs are all over the powerboxes, gang. Keep the power on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_17">...and cross your fingers.</string>
	 <string id="blm_cs1_01_03">You don&apos;t know me, but I see what you&apos;re up to, and I want in. Throw some money over the yellow wall by Jimbo&apos;s. And none of you guys better try and cross the road, or I&apos;ll call the cops. Ya hear me?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_52_01">Fantastic! You defused all of em&apos;. Get the money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_26_02">30 seconds, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_55_03">Right guys, great job but you gotta ---. There&apos;s movement ---.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_39b_01">That looks interesting, over there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_06_02">Have you checked the tool shed for the laptop?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_20_any_05">Cooking away fine - needs more acid though.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_08_04">Keep it together! Get him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_16_03">Medium rare or well done? Go for well done!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_11_01">Looks like you need to find a specific office, then.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_06_any_01">Two minutes, two minutes till the pick-up car is here! Hold them back!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_54b_any_06">... you guys are kicking ass and taking names!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_74_03">Reset the power lever, quickly!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_end_b_02">It&apos;s pretty hot out there. In fact I would bet you are more wanted than Mendoza now. Hector will probably think we&apos;re behind it, not being stupid. </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_16_02">Have you started looking in the terminal yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_13_02">Is the Commissar up to something? Get those fires out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_32_01">Now, my intel says that they have a hidden access point to the PEOC by the library. Make your way there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_35_03">Any sign of that office?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_33_01">OK, now open these gates. Should be a control box you can hack nearby.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_30_03">Blerrie, we&apos;re not cracking that in time. Going to need a code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_76_02">All right. Now let&apos;s just wait for him to try that drink. He&apos;s going to run for the John any second. Follow him. Get his keycard.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_37_03">Time to disconnect the hose, the plane is all full.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_13_01">Get to that security room and boost that footage! There&apos;s no time to waste.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_66_04">You have to plug in those batteries.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_07_01">Mount the saws on those transports!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_25_02">That should be enough to kick the Murkys in the teeth.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_81_03">Blow up the gate, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_43_03">That&apos;s the head of security. The pools, he&apos;s by the pools.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_68_03">That was fun!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_01_03">Leave the mask off for now and start by &quot;casing&quot; the place. Walk around a bit and see what we&apos;re up against.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_39_03">Almost time to leave. You just need to open up the runway.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrasch_stage1_brief_01">Yep. You heard him right. Vlad is serious. We go into the mall, we destroy as much as we can. </string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_60_03">You gotta get the van out of the way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_47_02">Get back to the mainframe and search for the second artifact.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_60_02">The cops shut down BFD. Deal with them, and start her up again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_21_01">Drill through the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_77_03">Another crate to crack open. Get to it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_28_01">SWATS are swarming below the roofs - you guys are completely surrounded.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_13_02">Ok, it&apos;s done! That was hard but I managed to open some of the shutters on the house.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_06_01">No code? Maybe look a little more.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_21_01">There&apos;s your ride. Once you&apos;ve got all the loot secured, you gotta get it refueled. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_170_01">C&apos;mon, gang! Get the bags, and assemble the winch.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_64_02">Just dash through and head downstairs to the garage!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_04_04">You&apos;re looking for the manager. Mid 40&apos;s, balding, black suit. Soulless, heartless, greedy...you know the type.</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_19_any_01">Oh shit, it&apos;s the cops! Let&apos;s get out of here! </string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_12_03">Pilot is down! Get him back on his feet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_22_03">That store looks like a good spot to search. Drill the door, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_36_05">I can&apos;t do any more until you find that keycard.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_54_03">Tap into the security boxes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_end_b_01">OK we got the address - he lives in a high security villa, up in the mountains, real secluded, luxurious area. We will be going in blind with no intel. Arm yourself and let&apos;s go. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_65_03">You can bounce now, or you can stay and give the Golden Grin a thorough cleaning.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_02">The cops are on our tail!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_15_03">Outstanding! That&apos;s all the goats! Now time to hit the road, gang!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_03_02">Nicely done, friends. That&apos;s what we&apos;re looking for.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_brf_01_01">We&apos;re working in the lab, late tonight, letting your eyes behold an eerie sight. Get cooking on the table, bubble and boil.And keep the cops from bringin&apos;, trouble and toil.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_10_02">I should&apos;ve know... there&apos;s another switchbox. You&apos;ve got to rewire that one too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_01_01">Damn, what is this place?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_108_03">A backup gate has been activated, use a drill to open it up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_12_03">I would prefer it if you just left before anything goes wrong, but I understand if you wanna go back to get more of the loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_26_02">Chopper is on its way with another lance. </string>
	 <string id="plt_run_01_02">Can you move up to a higher point? It&apos;s hard to get in close where you are now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_06_03">Might be a good place to look.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_03_02">The second keycard. Great work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_04_01">Thermite&apos;s done. Water&apos;s on its way. When the chopper arrives, you need to connect it to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_18_01">Ok, the doors are open. Get inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_32_02">I&apos;m thinkin&apos; that both number and color are important.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_34_02">Almost there, just wait for the drill to finish.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_14_01">Guys, you need to find that wagon - the one with the vault.</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_08_any_01">4 paintings, not much, but we&apos;ll take it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_33_01">New contact on Crime.net, guys. Got a shady politician with ambition. We call him The Elephant for now. Look him up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_end_win_01">Yeah. That didn&apos;t really go according to plan, did it? But we still got the job done and I&apos;m gonna unload the merchandise right away. As soon as we get our payday, I&apos;m cutting ties with the idiot that got us this job. Need to find out what the hell happened and who those mercs were. Got a feeling this job is gonna come back from the dead to haunt us.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_43_02">I just heard that the police will make a second opening in Wilson&apos;s house!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_17_01">I know you want to put a bullet in his face, but you got to stay focused, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_10_01">The wheel stopped on smoke!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_06_02">The whiteboard guys, find it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_87_03">The chopper will be there soon!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_27_01">Looks like the vault in the blueprint you found.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_75_01">Might as well call the elevator. One more sample and you can get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_38_01">Are you guys insane? Leave that bag!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_35_01">Okay, the EMP has been secured, which is what we came for. But there is still time to head back and get additional loot if you feel up for it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_55_02">You did it, you got a ton of money and got a lot of attention. And Gensec deserve to suffer publicly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_10_any_01">30 thousand dollars...</string>
	 <string id="rb1_bph_intro_01f">If the Dentist is up there, he&apos;s getting his teeth kicked in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_56_02">Get to that locker room and put those scrubs on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_28_03">Three digits. Outstanding! Now head to the vault and try them out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_35_01">They bought it. Keep working.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_17_01">It&apos;s going to be great... He will be there soon.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_18_01">The Oval Office is right there. Hurry, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_12_02">Excellent! With the BCI tech in safe possession, you have time to get more of the loot if you want to make some good money.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_53b_any_02">... but get more if you can!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_03_01">What an awful noise.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_48_02">...that gold would make a nice bonus. Bring some with you if you can friends, but remember why we&apos;re here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_12a_03">Ok, that&apos;s the one, there he is! Let him out, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_17_05">Hey, you can shoot coppers later. Get that door cracked.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_18_02">Going to leave this one at the silo! </string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_01_02">Ah, good. Butcher has send help. Untie me now please.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_10_03">Was that a coke-filled present falling from a tree? Christmas really is the time of miracles.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_69_01">Just saw another civilian stroll into the street. Deal with them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_97_01">We&apos;re running low on spending money, so if you find anything else worth taking...</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_51_01">That&apos;s the time lock done. Try and keep the sneak going. Now, the vault has a three step clearance control. The first I&apos;ve already taken care of. Just head there and use the fingerprint scanner.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_50_01">Tricky business. Gensec started mandating everyone wear &apos;em.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_05_08b">Fuck! I don&apos;t wanna die today!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_01_03">You need to find a way around the metal detectors at the entrance.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_63_01">OK, we need to get through that door. Maybe we can use that big dinges in the room to blast through. See if you can point it right, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_14_01">Pick up the phone or they&apos;ll know something is off.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_56b_any_01">... I&apos;ll be back in a minute!</string>
	 <string id="plt_mad_05_03">Straight through the roof. BOOM!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_86_03">The code begins with a five, according to my source.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_14_03">Someone pick up the phone. I&apos;ll talk to them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_09_03">The copy machine over there has a stash of equipment *if* this caper goes loud. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_17_02">Punch in the code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_19_02">This would be easier if the city wasn&apos;t a ruin. Just hold on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_brf_05_01">We have a stolen ambulance all ready to set up a roadblock, and a Gensec convoy en-route from Dulles. It&apos;s an old trick, but a classic. Get whatever&apos;s in the trucks to your escape driver. We&apos;re deep in Indian country here, gentlemen, so expect a fast response from D.C.&apos;s finest.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_130_01">Blerrie, there is a firewall blocking me on the network. Check the other computers and see if you can disable it. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_04_02">The bank manager wears a black suit. Balding. He looks like the kind of creep who spends all day on his phone.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_138_01">Bad news, friends. I can&apos;t come and get you while they have active air defences online. You gotta go and deactivate them!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_29_02">Watch for the helicopter. We&apos;re taking this stuff to the sky.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_46_01">Wait! I forgot about the briefcase... There should be a briefcase somewhere in the laboratory. You need to get it before you leave. Don&apos;t mind what&apos;s in it, just do it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_128_02">Next, old Locke needs to put a nice little computer virus into the system.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_02_03">So destroying his art collection didn&apos;t hurt enough. Let&apos;s try something else then.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_11_any_03">What a fucking waste of quality coke!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_93_02">The ghosts of a thousand years of heisters are watching you, and wishing they were here. Keep it flowing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_68_05">Great! We are back on track!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_02_01">Running low on ingredients? If you want to stay and cook a little more, there&apos;s a supply drop waiting in the wings for you... Just signal the helicopter. Or you can bail now. Your choice.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_22_03">Now that you got your hands on some thermite, we can easily melt the bars on the gate.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_35_02">Find anything with Garrett&apos;s wife?</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_13_01">He put it inside his shirt.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_04_02">Security box up head. Keep your eyes peeled.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_intro_a_02c">I&apos;d rather not piss off the cartel.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_41_01">Great work, now let&apos;s see that glittering carbon.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_27_01">There we go, friends. Now get inside and see if you can find the dinges we can here for. It&apos;s probably in a safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_12_03">Now let it do it&apos;s thing, and remember to keep the cops off it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_72_01">Good job friends, now just hoist it out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_06_03">Snipers! You gotta take &apos;em out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_90_03">Just follow the prisoner and he&apos;ll show you the way out of here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_61_01">Now get him to the server room!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_55_01">Great. Now the last step. Find the managers code. It should be on his computer.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_75_01">Get out there and clear the square, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_59_01">Damn. They locked the containers when the alarm went off. Break through!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_53_01">What now? A bluescreen? Ach!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_07_01">While you&apos;re at it, see if you can find anything in those stores that&apos;s worth some cash.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_02_03">Open ears. The safes are in the trucks. I need every single one to come out. Safely. Now, close ears. Get safes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_17_any_02">Now we&apos;re breaking even. Very good!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_25_02">Ahhh, I can smell the wealth from here! Load the bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_14_02">Get that C4 on the pumps at the station. Then stand back. Way back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_41_01">Bring those trees down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_17_03">There&apos;s a helicopter standing by to get you out. But as soon as you call it, things are going to get loud fast. So pick your moment.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_102_02">You need to complete the formula, prepare the next ingredient.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_12_03">Good, now take the saw off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_14_02">That&apos;ll do for Gage, but you can stay for more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_19_03">Right by the Jade Room, looks like a computer.</string>
	 <string id="btf_cs1_01_05">Absolutely, sir, not a problem. Would you like all of that in 20&apos;s?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_35_02">Niiiice. There we go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_51_any_01">OK, we&apos;re almost done!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_29_03">Good job, friends. One less secret occult mystery box for Murky. Take it and get cracking on the next, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_48_01">Have you found the server room?</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_39_any_01">It&apos;s open! Search through the deposit boxes!</string>
	 <string id="rb22_sah_intro_02b">They&apos;re just trying to prove they have imaginations.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_06_01">Just hang tight, my groovy ghoulies. Almost there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_78_05">Don&apos;t let the kerels get to the hacking device!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_14">He bombed a school. Good riddance.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_04_03">Good job. Now get it to the pick-up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_46_01">I&apos;ve got an idea about what we can use those for later!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_01_03">Do pekla! Finally, Butcher send help. You untie me please!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_52_04">I can&apos;t pull you out of there until you&apos;ve got through that floor, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_27_02">With this hard drive I should be able to override their security and get the vault open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fourstores_stage1_end_b_05">OK money secured. Vlad will be buying the vodka I&apos;m pretty sure and the police are gonna need some...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_05_03">The storage room is your target. That&apos;s where we&apos;ll find the keys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_28_04">Maybe if I send in a screwdriver by courier?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_37_02">That looks like it might be the server room. Better save it for after you find the cash. Remember where it is.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_07_01">Open your eyes and find the EMP. Come on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_end_01_01">It took two hundred years, but the Benevolent Bank has finally been robbed. Outstanding work!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_11_02">It&apos;s high time to find those three laptops.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_99_01">You&apos;ve got to bring him the right car key!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_17_02">The trucks are somewhere near. Keep an eye out for Vlad&apos;s couriers too. Don&apos;t drop them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_60_03">No explosives. Next container!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_07_03">Crowbars are probably inside the warehouse. Check it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_20_03">Ok, destroy things. What should we go for...</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_65_02">No time to stop and party, find those routers ASAP!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_07_any_02">OK, thats enough. Get the recording and lets get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_intro_01_02">Alright, that&apos;s the jewelery store. Get me the required amount and be ready for anything!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_67_01">Great! I&apos;m in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_06_02">Ok it&apos;s the toy store - Tin Boy!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_98_05">Hurry now, get that dinges some power.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_07_01">The blueprints indicate the vault is behind those doors.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_130_01">One moment please.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_101_05">Hurry and get the drill working again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_35_03">There&apos;s gotta be juice around there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_31_02">That&apos;s it, gang. Now get back to the trains and get your hands on the EMP bomb.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_53_03">Check the safe!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_34_02">Now bail out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_25_03">The garage is right below that Investment vault. It&apos;s where you need to plant the explosives.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_64_02">Grab Dentists&apos; loot. That&apos;s what we came for.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_27_03">So, that&apos;s it, yeah? Alright, friends. You need to cut the correct wires in the cable boxes to break the lock.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_10_03">This won&apos;t take long. Don&apos;t let anyone borrow the keys to the truck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_56_05">Good find. But you&apos;ll need more C4. Keep searching.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_166_04">And if you want, we can even make you toast.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_02_any_01">Holy shit! Looks like they&apos;ve electrified the vault!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_30_03">We need more C4 on the fourth floor and the roof.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_01_01">Ok friends, this one has been a long time in the pot. Time for some payback, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_51b_01">Guys, guys?! Are you still there? </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_70a_01">You got to get that stuff in the plane.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_08_01">Ok, the concert is finished. Get those masks off, and blend in with the crowd. You should be able to walk right back out the front door. The van will be waiting for you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_48_03">...the object in the floor is our main priority, but it&apos;s a shame to leave all that pretty gold here. Bring some with you if you can, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_intro_01_03">You&apos;re gonna get that Croatian ship out of the dock and berth. Gonna try and keep the volume low.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_01_03">Okay, we got a free lunch here. These guys are printing money in the basement. We&apos;re going to relieve them of their plates. If we sell it to the right party we&apos;re good for millions!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_08_03">No getting through that donnerse here. There&apos;s a scaffolding outside. See if you can find weak spot on the second floor, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_16_03">Alright, look&apos;s like it&apos;s working again. Great.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_39_01">The pilot is on his way. He&apos;s going to pick up the cage from the roof. Get it ready.</string>
	 <string id="crn_man_01_02">Like a glove!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_30_04">Open! Time to release the jailbird!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_22">Shit is getting real, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_23_03">Great! Add a few more, we want a proper blaze.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_10_01">The cops have this place surrounded. We&apos;re going to have to &quot;gracefully improvise&quot;.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_97_02">Try another one!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_54_02">Can&apos;t unlock the doors until you patch in properly.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_50_02">Time to go!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_15_02">Is time to leave, comrades! All aboard!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_kb7_01">You&apos;ve got to keep at least 7 bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_20_01">While we wait for that, and if you&apos;ve got the stones, get to the roof and get the zip-line set up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_82_02">Need the power back, guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_43_01">...If you find a keycard, opening one up would be pretty easy</string>
	 <string id="pln_fourstores_stage1_end_b_01">Money secured, the police got a taste of what we can do and Vlad will definitely be spinning that to his advantage. Nice. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_07_any_02">That&apos;s the door! Get inside!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_55_03">That&apos;s the alarm. Alright, weapons hot! Don&apos;t worry about the Moretta. She&apos;s moving and is gonna keep moving.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_25_03">Get a saw on that streetlight. It&apos;s the only way to bring the goat down.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_06_05">Somethin&apos; about this job ain&apos;t right. Just... something...</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_10_03">That&apos;s it friends, hurry back and get through the gate, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_15_03">Uhhh...no, that didn&apos;t work. Try another one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_36_03">Stay alive. Bile will drop the lance soon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_32_02">The first drill&apos;s finished.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_18_03">The stuff must be in the safe. Open it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_25_02">An associate of Gage&apos;s will help getting some of the loot out. Just toss it to him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_119_02">Great. Now toss it up onto BFD.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_34_03">And that is how you do it! Text book execution, gang! Congratulations!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_42_04">The water isn&apos;t pumping, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_14_any_01">They are climbing into the building!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_92_03">You should burn through the shutters with the Thermite you found, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_23_02">More C4. Not quite enough. Find the last batch. Keep searching.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_04_02">Vlad, you know... I encountered a Russian wolverine once...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_10_03">Power&apos;s down. Look for the circuit box and get it back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_135_03">How much did you win? Can we all retire?</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_01_01">...You got about a minute until the kerels get there. Keep those civvis under control, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_25_02">Gang, this isn&apos;t a place to do sightseeing. Get up there, come on, shift it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_06_02">Their databases are partitioned across two servers. Downloading the first one now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_41_01">Kill the rat!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_30_01">And now we wait. The Commissar can&apos;t hold up in there forever.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_dfb_05">Watch the bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_18_any_01">Damn it, they&apos;re burning it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_117_02">Can&apos;t do anything until you hook me up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_101_01">The drill has been shut down! Get it working again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_40_02">You gotta get that winch assembled.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_07_02">So, here&apos;s the thing. My car died, but I managed to haul away some diamonds. Stashed &apos;em in a nearby storage unit.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_13_01">Five.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_152_02">Here it comes. Room...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_35_02">They&apos;re blocking the road. Damn. Is there still room for the plane?</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_17_02">It&apos;s a security keycard for the railcars. That should speed things up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_116_01">BFD needs cooling. Refill the tank with water Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_04_02">Jesus H-Goddamn-Christ that took long!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_31_03">Holy shit, what is the delay. Burn the grate away with the thermal paste!</string>
	 <string id="rb5_bph_intro_01c">Fuckin&apos; Locke, always gotta spoil the fun.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_arrival_heli">The choppers ready. Get moving!</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_12_any_02">They locked the door. Use your head.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_05_01">I sure would be pissed off if that was my ride.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_27c_03">In case you felt like taking some nice things with you, there&apos;s a guy standing by if you send it out with a zipline.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_00a_02">Alright to repeat: Taxman is IRS, making a shady deal with some big corporation. He&apos;s selling them a server some with vital data.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap05_04">This is a nice house. Would look better with some of Vlad&apos;s furniture.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_90_01">OK now, the intel I got indicated that there might be thermite stored around there somewhere, so start looking. Once you find it, put it on the barrier.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_20_01">The drill is in the area. Get it, and get it to work on that vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_35_02">Come on. Climb aboard! Well fucking done, my friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_04_03">You got two options: Sneak by him or take him down. </string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_07_any_01">Stay alive till I get back for more!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_29_02">Staircase&apos;s blocked. Gotta be another way up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_36_03">So what? You thought it was a good idea to just leave them there? Alright gang, go get &apos;em.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_06_any_03">Nice, it&apos;s full!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_21_03">Now! Drop them!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_04a_03">Next is to find a way into the actual mansion.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_06_01">Damn. It&apos;s locked. Hmmm. Alright. The manager&apos;s still there. Take him as hostage. See if he has any information about the lock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_13_02">There&apos;s the control terminal. Hack it!</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cr2_02_03">Dropped the cargo. Hope you guys use it well.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_18_03">Tear gas incoming! Stay clear and wait for it to die down.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_08_02">This Payday Gang Cabot brought in... we sure this isn&apos;t their mess?</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_10_01">Okay, you got the stuff. That&apos;s the important thing. Time to bring it all to the helicopter. Get a move on, Bile&apos;s waiting.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_34_any_03">Shit this is top science stuff - use those brains - any color code, chemicals or such can be a clue.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_41_01">No, that&apos;s not it. Blerrie! Try again when it resets.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_25_01">No worries, friends. I&apos;ll get Bain. Just keep those Murkys away from us, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_08_any_01">Check in the back too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_70_01">Still waiting on the guest list, guys. Get to reception and download it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_91_02">OK, the wall behind the shrine is concealing an entrance, but you&apos;ll need to crack it open with some nice explosives! </string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_park_marksmen_rooftop_02">Heads up, the cops are deploying on a nearby rooftop!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_86_03">Find some tools to cut those chains!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_20_01">Helicopter inbound. Aw no, they will see Alex! Hide!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_44_any_01">Dr Fantastic! You guys sure are smart. We got the right engine and you are rich. Now make it out of there! Chopper is incoming.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_07_03">Ok guys, attach the next one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_00a_03">We screw &apos;em over, snatch both Taxman and the server. With those, we&apos;ll make a $25,000,000 hack. Alex, crane ready?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_69_04">Switch the power back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_08_01">There&apos;s thugs all around the building, gang. Take &apos;em out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_25_05">Go recode that key tag, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_61_03">There are the pardons! Go get them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_168_01">You&apos;re wasting time! Repair BFD, get her working and let&apos;s finish this caper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_11_03">We need to see the server before we go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_03_any_01">He said something about &quot;not trusting banks&quot; or whatever.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_114_01">Uh... Yeah... Their radios aren&apos;t working. Sunspot activity.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_29_01">SWATS are going for the ground floor, left staircase.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_14_02">Interesting security. OK, the panic room can only be accessed from outside by a code and two keycards. Look for them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_24_01">Alright, anyway... Let&apos;s find the Commissar in his penthouse and kill him. That bastard&apos;s gonna pay.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_15_any_05">I&apos;m off in 30!</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_19_01">This one&apos;s coming down at the bridge.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_38_03">One of you needs to grab the lance.</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_04_any_01">We count eight paintings. Good job.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_30_03">The vault&apos;s not going to open itself...</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrasch_stage1_end_a_04">OK we beat on this sorry mall enough for one day. Well done. Vlad has proven his point and I think we need to lay low for a bit after this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_12_any_02">The railway bridge! They are coming in from the railway bridge, keep them away.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap02_01">Hola?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_22_any_05">Caustic chloride. Says it is liquid form... Wait a minute... Should be soda, right ? </string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_23_03">Crap. This was supposed to be a milk run.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_f_04">Nope, that&apos;s not it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_17_02">Start moving the cash bags to the cage. That&apos;s how we get it out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_43_01">Guys, the maintenance tunnels could have what we&apos;re looking for.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_04_02">...caustic soda?</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_17_any_01">Only an ECM jammer&apos;s going to get that door open...Otherwise you need another way around.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_03_07">Acid. Muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_09_01">Yeah I know the way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_47_02">Just about ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_14_02">Great. Now bring that footage back here, and we can wrap this up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_66_02">You&apos;re cleared to leave, if you&apos;re done taking things.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_01_01">Christ, look at this place!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb2_03_01">How you like these wheels? Hop in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_07_03">Didn&apos;t you hear the man, gang? He needs a gas tank and exhaust pipes from the workshop. Get over there and deliver.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_15_02">Get that keycard, friends. Kill the bodyguard if you have to.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_78_01">You&apos;ll have to get into those boxes manually. Patch me in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_21_02">Try and get by him unnoticed. Take your time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_43_02">That&apos;s it. I&apos;m ready to lift this baby out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_05_02">Perfect, I can do this. Beginning hacking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_94_02">Outstanding! That&apos;s the vault code. Once we&apos;re in the Security Center, we can open the vault with it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_end_c_01">Great job, people. The Mendozas are out of business and their liquidity is riding shotgun in our chopper. Sweet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_03_02">Gang, hurry with the parachutes. Don&apos;t get off course.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_09_02">Get to the computer so we can code the tag for access.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_03_03">You&apos;re in the lair of the beast now, gang. Better loot, but bigger risk.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_35_02">Right console. And the left.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_01_03">Great. Now get the keys to Hox. Decrypting the servers will help pinpoint the traitor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_50_04">Might be dangerous, but you gotta get to the bio-lab friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_18_02">Can one of you please, when time permits, swipe the keycard in the lock?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_17_03">Remember gang, we need Garrett to keep breathing... for now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_65_01">Ok, go, go go! Get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_05_any_02">Careful. That&apos;s the door. It has got an alarm. We need to disable this first.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_07_01">They knew we were comin&apos;. Gimme a second here...</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_11_03">You&apos;re not going to have a look behind the doors?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_brief_01b">Oh, and there are probably rival Russian mobsters here. I know, Vlad is not being forthcoming with me either.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_38_01">Light &apos;em up. They will ping back up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_64_01">Boat&apos;s ready for you.        </string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_16_01">Might want to look in the fitness center. I saw something glowing there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_54a_01">Try the light fixtures. Maybe there&apos;s something there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_67_03">Mobster eliminated. Keep going.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_15_any_08">The getaway just left without you. Sorry guys, you&apos;re gonna be spending some time behind bars.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_22_03">Display case alarms are off now. Get your Dr. Jones on, fellas, and grab some antiquities. I know a guy who can fence this stuff. Trust me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_113_01">Good job! Now reactivate BFD!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_22_any_03">Ah! I said take it easy! Feds woke up! Find the server room and get out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_15_01">Alright. Give it a moment - let the gas dissapate. </string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_03_08">Even with all the conspiracy theories you&apos;ve ever heard or been told, who would ever believe this one?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_28_01">If you wanna leave, there&apos;s an escape panel on the top floor. Check it out if you wanna call it quits.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_27_03">The gang that stole the Diamond. Outstanding, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_55_02">Shit, the timelock has paused. Must be your ECM jammer that&apos;s making it go ape! Better holster those jammers.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_04_06">Don&apos;t worry about it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_12_01">Great job! I&apos;m sending the boat, keep looting!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_55_01">It was loud and got attention. Excellent work. Tough for Gensec though. Their new design is a joke.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_intro_02_03">Golden Grin, or bust!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_171_02">Get that winch secure!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_24_02">Florida cops don&apos;t mess around. They want to make a good first impression. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_08_03">That&apos;s our van coming back. Get ready, he is coming in!</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_22_03">Can&apos;t do much more in here, I&apos;ve almost gone through all the intel. We&apos;re gonna have to piece this all together back at the safe house. When we nail that traitor, the bastard is goin&apos; to die.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_07_any_02">15 grand guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_29_02">Good. Now lead him to the panic room and see his looks into the retinal scanner.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_34_any_01">Two more!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_06_01">Ok, I&apos;m in! Stand by. This shouldn&apos;t take me long.</string>
	 <string id="bkm_cs1_01_01">Yes sir, we&apos;ll help you with that right away.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_91_01">Now get into the chopper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_intro_a_02">You&apos;re going into the hornet&apos;s nest. So don&apos;t kick the damn thing, huh. </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_22_01">All right. I&apos;m coming in. You see a big black fucking chopper, that&apos;s me. Unless we&apos;re talking about what&apos;s hidden in your mums knicker drawer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_32_any_01">Everything except the tiara is for us!</string>
	 <string id="pln_can_brf_01">Straightforward job, this one. A bunch of thugs are running a little operation. Got a bunch of &quot;elves&quot; cutting coke that Vlad wants. Deal with the thugs, and then get the elves producing. Shouting at them should do it. Get as much coke as Vlad needs, and we&apos;re done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_21_03">Now that you got the keycard lets move on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_intro_01_01">Feels like old times, huh?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_20_01">Get ready!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_17_03">You gotta crack that door open, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_04_02">OK, thermite&apos;s through. A chopper is bringing the water. Connect it when it arrives.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_107_02">Ach! The Murkys have gone bossies!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_04_02">Not going to get in that way, friends. Go outside and find a back door to crack open with a saw.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_75_02">Can&apos;t take care of this until the square is clear.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_91_04">I have a van waiting, but it can&apos;t get through until the area is clear.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cr3_02_03">Need a refill. Be back shortly.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_59_02">Now you have to get inside the auctioneer&apos;s office and get the code. He should be carrying the keycard to it on his person, so go get it!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_64_any_04">Cover me! They&apos;re tearing me to pieces!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_25_02">Let&apos;s see... Place the keycard in the panel and activate that switch. Hope we&apos;re not in for a big suprise...</string>
	 <string id="loc_run_02_03">I&apos;ve found the target&apos;s location. Go hunt, my friends!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_08a_any_05">I&apos;m at the pick-up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_15_02">Hey! The cops are gonna stop the train further down the tracks, so you need to get the BCI tech and get the hell out of there!</string>
	 <string id="bkl_brn_intro_03">I wasn&apos;t really surprised by Rust&apos;s betrayal, you know? He was always an old and greedy fuck. But blood needs to be paid with blood, and you made a big-ass mistake by coming here. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_80_01">Now you just have to find a way into his office.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_g_02">It should be muriatic acid!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_124_02">Oh, no... now we&apos;re going to be here until tomorrow, for sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_66_02">Hmm, nothing. I suppose it would have been too easy for us to find our prize here. It&apos;s probably still locked in the evidence room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_17_03">Don&apos;t forget: we&apos;re looking for voting machines. My money is on them being in shipping crates scattered about.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_107_02">Now just mix it all together. Steady... careful now...</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_21_03">Where is that wine? Find it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_03_01">That&apos;s the stuff. Get it to the van.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_08_01">It&apos;s been ages since I was there last. They&apos;ve changed a lot of things.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_gold_brf_speak_03"> In unstable times like these, gold&apos;s all you can really depend on.  So who wants to go stabilize our economic future? The Harvest &amp; Trustee bank vault awaits.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_intro_03">OK, we need to clean the joint out. Eight bags ought to do it. Don&apos;t go easy on them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_36_03">That&apos;s a nice, full load. Sit tight, gang - Bile will be back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_21_03">You need to deal with the power box to use the ladder!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_56_02">We need to take that radar out of action. The missiles from the anti-air gun should do the work. See if you can use it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_brf_01">Kerels are going to go bossies when they see what we are after, and will be coming after us in droves, so keep your eyes peeled and take them down fast. The longer you can keep them at bay, the more desperate they&apos;ll get and give us a bigger load of cash, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_22_01">...have a look in the dumpers at the construction site outside, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_05_any_01">I love banks. The smell of all that money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_52_01">OK, that&apos;s our minimum. Grab more if you want, or get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_25_02">You&apos;re not going to tempt that goat down with nice words and treats. Saw the streetlight!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_16_06">That&apos;s a beautiful car. Shame. But it&apos;s part of the job.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_13_any_03">I have to leave in two minutes!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_61_01">OK, get into that tunnel. Time for a visit to Mexico.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_07_02">OK, your pick-up is ready. It can carry as much ammo as you can get to it, if you want a bonus. Up to you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_03_05">You gotta find the laptop if you want to get the money.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_68_02">Get a flare going so Bile can find you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_08_06">Get that bastard!</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_01_05">Hey, hold the door!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_11_01">Everything working again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_52_03">Keep the water flowing, gang. Just a little more. Then just rig it, and let hydrodynamics do its job.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_02_02">The fucking Hondurans found us! How did they follow us?!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_44_01">All right! Signal the blimp. And do it Vegas style. Find some fireworks and light them up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_misc_sj_dgh_04_03">That&apos;s it. Let them piss their pants while we do our thing at the bank. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_end_03_01">Nice haul! This will bring in a nice chunk of change. Good job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_11_03">OK, now how about those laptops?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_09_01">Chopper&apos;s got to leave soon. Hustle if you want to be on it, but it&apos;ll be back soon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_56_01">More C4. Almost there. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_misc_sj_dgh_04_01">Good. Let the bastards squirm in fear while we take care of the bank. </string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap01_01">Where the fuck is Raúl? You were supposed to find him! I have 50 guests coming tonight and you pull this shit you fucking whore! I will send you back to fucking San Dimas!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_67_02">Still don&apos;t know you&apos;re there. Look for the keycards.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_78_03">Garrett&apos;s going to have a fun time explaining that one for sure. Now get that box secured and get out before the kerels arrive.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_23_01">Great, I&apos;m in. Keep watching those hostages.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_49_01">You can finish this when you want, but grab as much as you can.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_15_any_02">Awesome you got them all - I think.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_30_01">Don&apos;t forget the box, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_52_02">Damn. Should have told him the code was kiss your own ass. Get ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_47_any_03">Ah... OK guys, we got a small refuling need for the chopper. He is dry. You guys gotta stay put for about 10 - 15 minutes. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_26_01">That&apos;s as far as I can take it. Look around for something that might narrow down his location.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_01_01">All safely down? Great. Locate the crash site, and see if the pilot&apos;s still alive. If he is, you need to get him to a safe place. I&apos;ll get a chopper out to pick him up ASAP. A plane doesn&apos;t crash out here without causing attention, so you can expect company. Work fast.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_10d_01">You&apos;ve defeated the tenth wave of cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_39_02">That crowbar will be useful with all these shipping crates.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_11_02">The wheel stopped on drills. Do you guys know what that means?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_06_03">Never get tired of seeing gold bullion getting bagged.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_49_02">Go! Go! Go! Just run!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_104_02">The vault, gang. It has the deposit boxes, and they have the money.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_03_01">There&apos;s a power box nearby, see if you can&apos;t take out those detectors.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_14_any_02">That plane must have dropped of the guns for Mendoza. Hurry up guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_168_02">Fix up BFD and let&apos;s finish this. Come on, crew, we&apos;re so close.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_59_02">Stop screwing around, guys! Now you gotta grind through metal doors for ages.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_12_02">You got snipers around there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_08_02">The machine&apos;s done. Keep going. The Elephant wants to make sure his man wins big.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_01_03">We can&apos;t screw this one up friends. We gotta get it done, proper.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_05_01">Friends, it&apos;s probably best to go in through the back door with a saw, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_92_02">To set it up we&apos;ll need some diesel fuel, fertilizer, wire and a timer. Look around if there&apos;s anything like that around there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_13_01">There&apos;s a lot of stuff in here! I guess you&apos;ll know what you&apos;re looking for when you see it.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cs1_09_01">Almost there. Target in sight. Over.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_71_02">You gotta get back to the skylight.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_108_01">Chopper is on the way! ETA 2 minutes.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_13_any_01">I&apos;m coming in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_intro_a_02">We&apos;ve got a chance to make this the greatest political comeback this town has seen since Nixon. Get in there, clowns.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_10_02">These people don&apos;t give up! Let&apos;s show them, shall we?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_36_02">Now, we need to set the trap. More gasoline in container 12.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_04_01">Blerrie! You&apos;ll have to go through the back door with a saw, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_06_01">OK, now get to the Oval Office in the West Wing. Find the access point. </string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_51_03">You can go get more C4 outside if you need it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_10_any_01">OK, I have access. There&apos;s two Gensec alarm boxes we need to disable, I&apos;ll mark them for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_09_01">What are you waiting for? Get through that gate!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_08_03">Bring that beast down, gang.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_57c_01">There is old saying in Ukraine. Revenge is a dish best eaten by sharks.</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_05_01">Ah! That noise! Another package fell, I think, yes?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_07_02">Remember to grab the C4. That is your way through the door.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_07_01">Fuck this shit man.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_27_02">Damn it to hell! What is wrong with a traditional security door that you can drill? Looks like you&apos;re gonna need the actual lead scientist for hand print authorization. Find him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_15">...bekaken internet descriptions are not too clear.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_103_01">There goes another one... I can&apos;t...</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_10_01">Something wrong with hose.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_08_04">I can last a year in here, you pig-fucks!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_06_02">Get moving! Get past the cops and rendezvous with Eddie!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_57_any_04">OK, I can&apos;t stay here forever!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_09_02">Blowing the walling will wreck the ballot machines. Accident, right? We&apos;re just doing an honest bank heist.</string>
	 <string id="btm_cs1_01_02">And if I could get you to sign here, here, here... here, and here. And sign here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_98_02">Ooh, nice bit of hardware, that! Going to be useful for sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_run_04_03">I&apos;ve got a helicopter to pick you up. I got someone familiar, so you can use your frequent flyer points.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_39_01">Light a flare to signal Bile. We need a big damn drill to get down there, which first needs a winch. He&apos;ll bring the parts for it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_11_03">These terminals likely have info on the Moretta. You can search it if you want. Intel&apos;s always useful.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_26_04">Go to the armory and find something that opens doors!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_19_02">So you reached the top? Have the prisoner buckle up and then release the balloon. The plane will be coming in soon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_28_02">Get that C4 placed guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_32_01">Great you got the gas. Might need more though.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_76_02">The plane needs juice to fly.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_42_03">Try another combination of symbols and order, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_61_03">Time to go to Mexico, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_17">He was a bakvissie anyway.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_78_03">There&apos;s probably a crowbar around here somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_01_02">I need all y&apos;all assholes on point tonight! Especially you up in the booth.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_b1_02">It&apos;s muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_13_01">With that keycard we should be able to get the door opened.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_30_03">Worth checking in the Amber Room for a PC.</string>
	 <string id="plt_mad_04_02">Give me 30 seconds and I will drop that EMP.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_01_01">Welcome back! See, you didn&apos;t even have to answer the phone, I&apos;m keeping my eyes on you as usual!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_34_01">And... Done! Ship&apos;s moving. Sit tight guys, this will take some time! Try not to get killed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_16_04">Get the prisoner, don&apos;t leave him behind!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_22_03">The drill won&apos;t break that door. You should try the armory and see if there&apos;s anything you can use.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_10_03">I got an Inside Man there. They&apos;ll help us get through to the gates leading to the vault. Patching them through now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_94_02">There you go, that&apos;s the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_34_03">I think Buluc&apos;s office is upstairs. Get up there and confirm, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_14_01">Get inside the vault, gang. See what&apos;s inside!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_74_03">Guys rappelling from that chopper to the roof. Get at them!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_28_06">You can&apos;t leave without finding that safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage3_06_any_01">I&apos;m sending a chopper in for you guys to unload the loot. It&apos;s close by, shouldn&apos;t take too long. Stay tight.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_46_03">It&apos;s too hot for the van driver. He&apos;s bugging out. Don&apos;t worry, though. Got a chopper gassed and ready for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_28_01">OK, for the retinal scanner we need the FBI boss. Find him and take him hostage!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_37_02">Twitch is arriving with the van to pick you up. He&apos;ll wait by the upper bridge side.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_01">It doesn&apos;t look good, guys - it doesn&apos;t look good!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_41_02">Ice that rat bastard!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_03_01">Find the bank manager, then tie him down and you&apos;ll get the keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_34_01">We&apos;re wasting time here! Get that winch going again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_10_01">Lekker! That&apos;s the spot. Cut through the top layer with a saw, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_swats_deployed_02">The cops know the snipers wont be able to finsh this. They&apos;re prepairing to send in the troops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_15_03">I heard something...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_83_04">You still have to take the boxes from the conveyor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_42_01">Don&apos;t smash the glass or the alarm will go off. Use a glass-cutter.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_01_01">This is Hilary over at Gensec. Just checking in. Is Barney there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_36_01">Doors. You can try these out too. Keep in mind that there are lots of ways to get one open. In our line of work, closing doors is pointless - opening &apos;em is what matters.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_10_04">That&apos;s done it, but you don&apos;t have much time before the system restarts, so get back to the gate!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_48_03">All right. Now bunker down, gang. Hold them off until we burn through.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_18_02">Welcome to Mexico amigos. Try not to make a ruckus.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_53_01">At least the safe is intact.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_16_03">Great guys! No one keeps you out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_28_03">Screws don&apos;t usually unscrew themselves. You gotta help.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_119_01">Thank you for your call. Roberts appreciates the chance to talk to you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_12_02">Guys, I need you in the construction yard. It&apos;s the only way out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_01_03">I&apos;m calling in a helicopter to pick you up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_44_01">There&apos;s several rooms in the maintenance tunnels. Have you checked all of them?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_01e">Careful!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_08_03">This is it. Bust your way in. Don&apos;t care how you do it, just do it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_01_02">OK, friends. Let&apos;s do this. Make your way into the bank.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_33_01">You need to get Santa up the tree so he can fly out with it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_83_02">Power is back, great. Now don&apos;t stop. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_86_01">Thats three. You&apos;re going strong. Keep going.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_intro_a_03">That&apos;s the warehouse where the voting machines are kept. Time for a little political engineering.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_18_03">Put the ticket in the gate. Let&apos;s finish this.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_04_02">What&apos;s taking so long? Don&apos;t waste that thermite.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58e_02">Ach, bunch of kakspul! You gotta take out that turret for a clean getaway.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_74_02">The chopper is deplying to the roof. Be careful!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_49_02">Get those stones. </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_02_01">Going to be a long day, isn&apos;t it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_02_02">The sooner you get to the wine cellar, the sooner we can get this done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_42_03">Don&apos;t get lazy, gang. Search the whole train yard if needed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_11_02">Find the room that controls those bollards. Gotta be here somewhere. Check the doors.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_18_01">Well, you got a decent amount. Just about covers the gas money. Maybe next time we can push it further.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_21_01">Gensec pumped a lot of money into this place. Look at it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_122_02">If you don&apos;t get me up and running, we&apos;re in serious trouble, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_09_any_03">You gotta hurry up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_15_03">Dozer? That can&apos;t be good.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_05_01">Good, now get it back to Hoxton!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_40_03">The prisoner knows the way out. Just keep an eye out for guards.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_52_06">Check the files, whiteboards,walls... everything...</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_09_any_06">Watch your backs!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_36_01">There&apos;s a combination to open this door. I was able to find out that you can find it in Buluc&apos;s inner sanctum, whatever that is.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_09w_01">Ok, here comes the ninth wave!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap03_01a">Hello.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_14_03">Gage has what he wants. Great work. You can bug out now, or hang around a little.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_18_04">The vault, guys. ASAP.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_06_02">Damn, they interrupted the hacking.Get it started again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_117_02">Will one of you clowns just grab that loot, please?</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_80_01">Chopper coming in! Roof guys, roof!</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_03_01">Here! I&apos;m getting to that server. Kill every last fucker ya see!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_13_any_03">Check the trees - cops advancing.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_01_03">Fucking phones are fucked. Ah, my friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_73_02">That would look lekker in Duke&apos;s corner, for sure! Maybe you should take it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_36_01">It&apos;s done. Look at all that loot! Now grab as much as you can before you escape!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_16_01">That&apos;s it. The Commissar is dead. We&apos;re one step closer to getting Hoxton back. I&apos;m sending in a helicopter, so stay put. Good work up there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_77_02">There&apos;s a time lock on the door because of the alarm. You have to wait a bit.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_13_02">You got a SWAT Van coming!</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_08_01">Swell, these will make Cabot happy after all this is done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_75_01">Alright guys, It&apos;s time to get outta there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_intro_06">OK, friends time to get in character.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_11_01">You still need to find the three laptops to get the code fragments.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_83_04">He might have been moved to an interrogation room.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_02_04">Jesus Christ guys, come get me before the cops do. I&apos;m at the far back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_73_02">We&apos;re stuck without that keycard. Find Ralph garnet!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_25">...I&apos;m 72% sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_39_03">If you get the code order wrong, all hell will break loose.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_173_03">We need a code to open the armory. Three digits. Colour coded. They&apos;re somewhere in the Grin. Get searching!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_29_03">Crap, wrong computer. Cops are incoming. You don&apos;t have much time now.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_09_any_04">Really!? Hurry the fuck up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_85_01">Friends, you got to tell me what all the fuss is with those fish tacos. Sounds pretty awful if you ask me. Maybe if it were shark fins...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_24_01">I think we might need to spin another wheel. Find it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_40_01">This is like candy for Duke, yeah? But we just need what&apos;s inside. Those symbols are probably the key to opening it. Look around for clues.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_intro_01">Feels like we&apos;re going to get a kakspul of payback with this one, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_95_03">So much value in such a small space.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_40c_02">Huh.... that door is code locked. </string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_41_03">Take a look at the vault. I&apos;m pretty sure our pardons are kept in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_41_02">There&apos;s a conveyor chute over there. It can carry the loot to....let me check.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_07_04">Transport&apos;s here. Get the bags to the van!</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_08_05">That&apos;s the part he asked for. One step closer gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_61_01">A case. Could be our girl&apos;s explosives. Check what&apos;s inside, now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_08_01">Okay. That&apos;s good. Now get more in there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_59_01">There, I&apos;ve got access to the vault system. Give me a few to crack it open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_28_01">Don&apos;t rush it. Just let him pass then you can move.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_09">The cops are on our tail!</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_06_06">Cabot&apos;s is gonna have to fuckin&apos; pay extra for this shit.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_28_02">Make sure you get the code right.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_60_02">Answer the phone! </string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58c_03">Time to get you all out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_41_05">Coppers have stopped the winch! Keep them away from it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_b2_04">...muriatic acid?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_45_01">You need to restart the device.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_03_any_01">Have you found it yet? They probably kept it somewhere safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_31_02">That&apos;s a LOT of beautiful gold. Outstanding work, gang!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_90_03">Lots of people and cars blocking access to the bank. Clear out the area so the escape van can get through.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_01_any_02">OK, here&apos;s the setup: we&apos;re looking for the paintings with red stickers on them. Security is going to be on the heavy side, cameras and guards. </string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_55_any_03">I&apos;m afraid the cops will find me here!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_66_any_01">Don&apos;t mind that one, I&apos;ll get that one!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_33_03">Watch out for those bags now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_03_any_01">Good, you are inside. Now, locate the server room.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_19_03">The bridge looks good. Dropping the cage there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_58_02">Just attach the cable to the pick-up and the hatch.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_20_02">Hey! Answer the Intercom!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_23_04b">Holy shit... I just wanna get this crap over with...</string>
	 <string id="vld_nightclub_brf_speak_02">So you go in and you will find his safe and other moneys. He will have lots. He does not trust banks and he trusts only Russians. Go in party - and go out and party!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_61_02">Get that thermite back to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_15_02">If you&apos;re feeling rough, maybe spend a keycard and crack the Infirmary open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_77_02">Twitch, you are good to go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_98_01">Ach, you crossed the lasers! You gotta find a way to shut that system off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_end_01_01">Haha! You did it! This jewelry should be worth a few bucks don&apos;t you think?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_01_any_03">Quietly now. Sneak up and hit them hard. </string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_23_02">Why not? It&apos;s effective!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_17_02">Ok, connect me and I&apos;ll have this done in a few seconds.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_16_01">Bam! That&apos;s one less flank to worry about.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_39_03">...Time to pull that door off, yeah? Start the winch and keep the kerels from getting to it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_80_02">Guys, I&apos;m getting a bad feeling here. Military-industrial com channels are going like crazy. Looks like we caught some nasty attention.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_18_any_03">FBIs most wanted. You&apos;re going to make it. Take the god damn server now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_71_02">OK, I&apos;m done here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_31a_01">I reckon you will find keys around there somewhere, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_107_03">Don&apos;t forget to grab C4 from the armory.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_62_01">Are you ready for the fireworks show?</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_14_03">Good, good. Don&apos;t surrender now. </string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_20_any_03">They just got your escape driver - your driver&apos;s dead! I need a plan B - hang on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_31_03">What are you standing around for? Find the garage.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_53_01">Find the server room. We&apos;ll try to override the security lock.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_20_02">No standing around. Find the plane, quickly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_57_01">Damn! They locked out the code. Need a backup plan.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_47_04">If you&apos;re low on gear, go back and check the drop point outside, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_30_any_14">That&apos;s 18!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_07_02">All these apartments have sprinkler systems. Just look for the valve.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_21_01">Gang, we still need a way to get through that steel gate . You need to find something that we can use.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_07_01">Just press the button. You can understand that, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_05c">I&apos;ve always wondered what Murky&apos;s Top Men look like.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_01_03">Those Murky bastards are going to be trying to ship the goodies out, so check their containers!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_36_01">That&apos;ll keep it going for now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_13_02">The vault is open. This charade is almost done. Bag some money!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_31_03">Okay. Time to head back to the trains and get that EMP in the bag.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_02_06">Alright, the next ingredient is...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_75_01">Woah! Wherever Commissar is, he heard that!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_04_02">Still trying to follow up all the threads. Try to keep focus.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_105_04">You&apos;ve got to connect the wires!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_11_01">The FBI have installed a panic room in the mansion. You can bet the traitor is hiding in it. Find it. Then we can figure out how to get inside!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_78_02">Come on guys! You can do it!</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_11_01">Fuck, goddamnit!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_41_02">Got anything on the symbols yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_83_01">Good. One down, one more left!</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_08_03">Should I send a team over to help you look?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_23_any_01">Alex made the drop, I knew I was right in giving him a third chance.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_78_02">Surely there has to be a way to open the crates. A crowbar or something. </string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_33_any_01">They&apos;re inside!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_14_03">Blerrie fingerprint scanner. OK, who&apos;s got some tape? Does anyone have any tape? You can use it to lift the manager&apos;s fingerprints off an object and open that dinges without making a lot of noise.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_13_any_02">Guys, the pick-up is near that crane.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_56_01">What are you waiting for? Set that detonator!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap06_01">Tell me, old friend. How many years will you spend in purgatory, before going to hell?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_39_01">Enter the wrong code and the alarm goes off, so be careful!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_02_02">Good work. Just need to find one more keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_07_06">Open the trucks! Use the saws!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_04_02">Fancy place like this will keep the keys secure. Look for a storage room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_30_03">I run into one of those back in the days. We fill the safe with water and detonated a bit of C4 inside. The water pressure threw the door open without damaging any of the content inside the safe.</string>
	 <string id="cpn_cr2_01_01">Port of Washington Radio one zero one E. This is Moretta. Over.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_99_02">Damn it! More frickin&apos; laser beams. All right, no time to figure out where the system is controlled. Just watch the pattern and hurry through.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_103_01">You ordered the truck, so get the loot to it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_19_01">Guys, keep out of that corridor.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_37_03">This was fun, yes? But it&apos;s time to go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_15_01">The door is open! Now, time to put this caper to bed. Deal with him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_07_01">Their door system uses coded key tags. We&apos;ll need to make one. See if you can find a blank tag somewhere around the office.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_09_01">Alright, buddy, I&apos;m sending a team over right now.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_18_06">Keep the pyro for the show, guys. Get the fire dealt with, lickety-spit!</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_18_03">I can see the fire and smoke from here. Grab an extinguisher and get it out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_11_01">OK, it looks like one of the artifacts is being stored in the warehouse archive. There&apos;s no way you&apos;ll be able to search that area on foot, but there&apos;s a retrieval system with a crane in the central hub you can use. You just gotta find the right shelf first.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_42_03">This way, my friends, with all haste.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_09_02">All right, drop it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_cnc_01_03">This one is a hit on the Teuer dealership. High class joint.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_12_01">That&apos;s it, you made it! Throw the coke in the van and let&apos;s go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_44_01">Friends, hook me up to the mainframe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_59_01">The silent way to open those doors would be to use the keys. If you can find them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_run_02_02">Alright, I&apos;ve got the target&apos;s location. Go get him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_20_any_01">They shot the driver, damn it! They shot the driver! I gotta try another option - hang on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_05_02">You got metal security doors blocking the storage room. I can unlock them remotely if you hack their control boxes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_32_02">Get back to the trains and get the EMP.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_27_03">Come on friends, push him over the edge or something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_22_03">Good. Now see if you can find something to steal. Something that draws their attention away from the encrypted flash drive.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_75_02">Now get out of there without triggering the alarm, and this is a perfect stealth job.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_21_03">Great. Now get it across the yard. Look for the crane controls.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_28_01">You can escape now, or maybe look for more valuables. Your choice.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_37_01">Get up on the roofs, friends. Maybe you will see things clearer up there, yeah? You&apos;ll probably need a ladder to get up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_26_02">There are more of the attackers down in the street!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_07_03">Diesel will fill when pump is started.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_15_02">Look for a way to get to the train quickly. Don&apos;t want you guys handling those old Russian nukes longer than you need to.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_36_01">Next, set a fire trap in container 12.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_96_03">Get the right key for the car!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_05_03">Don&apos;t be overeager gang, store&apos;s not going anywhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_41_02">Perfect, now grab those stones.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_09_any_01">Loot van is on the way. ETA: One minute.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_68_04">The fire was killed by sprinklers!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_72_03">Reactivate the charging panel.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_18">We got a tail - and they&apos;re getting closer!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_32_03">Bah, surveillance didn&apos;t show that. Well, you gotta get through it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_10_01">That looks about right. Open it up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_103_03">The keks are using tear gas! Stay out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_66_02">Now use the card to get inside the server room. Second floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_08_any_01">The van is right around the corner.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_82_03">My connection is broken, you gotta get it back up again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_06_01">They interrupted the hack! Restart it!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_03_01">Hello? I am coming through? Boat will need more fuel to make international waters.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_57_01">Make the piece of shit fall in the ocean!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_04_02">You realize how many dollars I sunk into that place? Enough to pay for your ass ten times over, bastard!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_04_any_01">OK, Hector wants us to record this, so first: set up the camera.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_32_02">Wonderful! I believe that that is enough to make this a worthwhile venture. Please, ensure all of the bags are placed on the cables and sent up to me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_18_01">We need a new plan... this guy has really burrowed in... hmm...</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_03_06">Hurry up and go inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_12_02">Defend Hoxton. If you have cards, you can seal off the entrances.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_81_01">Great job, friends! That&apos;s both boxes. Head back to the entrance so that I can get you out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_71_01">You guys are professional ghosts. Now get to the computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_01_any_01">So the plan is, go in, get me the following objects. When you have them we&apos;ll connect them to our station on the roof.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_83_03">Great, now get back and get through that door, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_02_01">I trust you have had a vacation worthy of real heisters. You worked hard, you needed it, but you are needed once again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_16_02">Ok I have an idea for that heli. Pour some gas on those tires and light it up. Should create a smokescreen.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_65_02">Dammit, they shut off the power. Get it back on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_18_01">Use that paper shredder - it&apos;s the easy way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_29_01">Same procedure as last time - grab the loot or leave this prison on the top floor.</string>
	 <string id="plt_run_09_01">Get him into the chopper. I can&apos;t hang around here forever.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_intro_01">This place is crawling with guards. You need to grab anything technological of his that isn&apos;t nailed down - mobile phones, laptops, hard drives. Slip in and find the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_31_03">I loved this room as a kid, but now... Makes me uneasy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_44_03">The code was wrong, they know you&apos;re there now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_01_03">Dear friends! Enjoying the flight so far, yes? You&apos;re almost at the location I have selected as a drop point. So...</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb2_03_03">No-one will look twice at us in this ride. Get in!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_32_03">See that boat? That&apos;s your way out right there. Yeah, for sure. Get in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_25_03">This is not a good day for Murkywater or the Dentist, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_09_any_01">Looks like blueprints of the inventor&apos;s house. Very tasty.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_17_02">There you go, see if you can pull a print.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_18_01">Remember: you need to find some gas and get it on the tires!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_31_01">That&apos;s your way out, but you can&apos;t leave yet. Wipe the crap off your shoes and secure the money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_11_01">That&apos;s it, gang!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_37_02">Merry Christmas! Let&apos;s get out of here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_52_02">Hurry friends! Stop it from running a firmware update or we&apos;ll be back at the start!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_14_03">We really need that escape car now! How long do you think it will be?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_07_01">Great work. There&apos;s always a market for untraceable guns.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_end_b_03">Deal&apos;s on, people. You made enough crystal to make royalty blush. Hector&apos;s going to be singing your praises if he isn&apos;t high as a kite. Well done.</string>
	 <string id="elp_framing_brf_intro_01">I require your assistance in a matter...</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_10_any_01">That&apos;s the second external hard drive.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_15_02">Out-goddamn-standing! You guys are world class (sniffling) World class, ya hear!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_14_05">That batch needs to go somewhere safe, chop chop. Then you can have another go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_39_01">...Start the winch and let it work. Keep the kerels away, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_12_02">You need to find those code fragments.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_58_03">Remember: blood poisoning and abnormal heart rate. Listen to Schneider.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_69_02">Boom, bang and tumble! Great! </string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_intro_02">Bain, I know you&apos;re sick but that was the worst joke, for sure!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_77_03">Chop, chop, people!</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_27_any_01">Confirmed! I&apos;m coming in at dock nine!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_29_02">Look in the Sales office for a PC.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_76_03">Don&apos;t take your eyes off that cannon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_30_01">Down there - your own vault. To the right is your camera system. Left your Crime.net station. Let&apos;s roll.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_26_01">Get down there, I&apos;ll show you a secret.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_117_01">Moretta. This is Port Washington radio. Free to clear dock and berth at 3B. Stand by for GPS data. Over.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_05_03">You gotta find that code, friends. Check the rooms.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_04_01">Okay, now you need to look for the actual Murkywater trains.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_27_01">Raise the balloon guys - higher up so the pilot can catch it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_12_03">Keep moving, guys. You gotta go to the next building.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_29_02">Ach, you chops put in the wrong code!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_37_03">Do you see the shaft? Yes, just send the bags of loot up here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_33_02">Good job. Now, secure the EMP at the escape area before grabbing any additional loot.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_40k_03">The blowtorch should cut through the gate easily enough. Get to it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_02_02">Commissar&apos;s boys are crawling over this place like roaches. Exterminate them before they burrow into the rooms.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_33_02">This tree is going to fly, my friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_09_any_01">Great! Now set up the connection again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_09_02">Ah, it&apos;s one of those. See if you can find something around there that will match the lights.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_39_02">Great job, gang. The scan is complete.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_172_01">Connect the winch to BFD with the hook.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_07_02">Cops ahead!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_51a_02">Oh...damn!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_13_any_03">Find some cover, warehouse looks defensible.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_30_01">Easy pickin&apos;s if you grab it on the way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_13">Ha, he always said he wanted to die in a brothel. Well, at least he got fucked, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_35_any_03">It just got to be in there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_79_01">Here&apos;s one of the things you need.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_41_03">You&apos;re pushing your luck by staying...</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_42_02">Help him with the door.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_14_02b">Okay, I need a gas tank and some exhaust pipes. There&apos;s a ceiling lift inside the workshop and that&apos;s where the bikers store them. Get the stuff down and toss them to me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_63_01">You are looking for blank paper rolls and ink. Grab both and feed it to the printing machine.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_55_03">That should be it! Great stuff! Come on, Commissar...  Call...</string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_02_02">You think I&apos;m asshole? Well, in Russia, asshole fucks you!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_81_03">Have you secure all the contraband yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_54_01">Good job, now let&apos;s get you into some scrubs.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_end_a_01">Wow. Russians would call this tactic scorched earth. Very aggressive. I&apos;m sure Vlad will pour you a shot of vodka in thanks. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_f_10">Shit!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_44_03">Gha! Those dwankies have stopped the bomb. Get over there and restart it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_84_01">That&apos;s the first bag. That&apos;s what we need, but keep going.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_40_03">I can&apos;t do it for you people. Keycard and code, in that order.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_19_01">It worked! Great. Now keep the cops off it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_end_b_01">So the senator&apos;s people are very appreciative. The boss is hanging the art. Guy has no clue we&apos;re going to clean him out. Oh well. Nice work grabbing the money by the way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_43_02">Screw the winch down good. Believe me, you need it stable for the next part.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_01_03">City of Angeles. Looks like the quake made a few more...</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_59_02">With the anti-air defenses out of the way, Bile has free passage to drop the EMP close to the lumber mill.</string>
	 <string id="plt_mad_06_04">It landed right out in the open. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_34_03">Damn! The cops have the mall locked down. So we&apos;re getting you out by air. Light a flare for the chopper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_01_03">You can try finding vault keycards, two of them, if you want to sneak this place. Maybe in the trunks. Or go loud - it&apos;s your choice.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_08_03">Great, that&apos;s the part he needed.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_14_03b">Hmm... Ah, okay! I need some exhaust pipes and a gas tank. There&apos;s a ceiling lift in the workshop. They store them up there. Get me both and I&apos;m all happy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_56_01">I can move sapphires too, if you grab any along the way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_64_01">I&apos;ve got the root on the IRS server. We are in the jar.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_04_03">Look out for the manager. 40&apos;s, black suit, balding. Probably around the back offices. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_25_02">Just one more, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_06_01">Great! Now find a scanner in IT. Fax me a copy of the blueprints. I&apos;ll find that vent.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_04_04">We&apos;re going over the goddamn top with this. Now, when I give the word, you hit the button. Got it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_16_01">The truck&apos;s open. Get in there and crack the safeboxes. We need at least two bags of loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_55_01">But hell, if you&apos;re good - that&apos;s the edge you need.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_11_05">The bag of diamonds is in one of the storage units.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_09_03">Ahhhh, the meth is done, but we can&apos;t get it out as it is. Need to break it down. Get smashing, gang!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_33_02">Friends. You got more Murkys coming in, so be careful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_55_02">Almost there. Final protocol - the managers code. Check his computer.</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_cbf_01">My asshole brother-in-law, that useless sack of ball-skin, has crashed his plane. He hit something and ... We can&apos;t let the cops pick him up. Normally I wouldn&apos;t give two shakes of my pisser for that drunken asshole. I&apos;d let him rot there, but, you know... Family. Track that old soak down and get him out. I&apos;ll pay a nice Christmas bonus for any of his packages too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_02_02">That&apos;s the ordnance, but it&apos;s not the turret. Get it out if you can, but keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_19_01">Hurry now, get to the canteen!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_27_03">Dammit! They yanked the hose. Get there, get it back on.</string>
	 <string id="txm_man_01_01">It&apos;s nearby. Can I see the funds?</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_01_01">This guy&apos;s something else! Looks like he broke free on his own! But you gotta help him!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_04_04">Welcome to the labyrinth, motherfuckers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_19_any_01">Sorry guys, he says this ain&apos;t the one. I&apos;ll be back in a few so you can give me the working one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_04_06">Don&apos;t give that sniper time!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_59_01">What&apos;re you doing, shooting up the place! They&apos;re gonna lock it down, now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_intro_01_01">No worries, the Payday gang always pays our debts, yeah?$NL;</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_02_08">Answer the Intercom. Don&apos;t make me come over there, son.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_25_02">You need to bring that thermal drill into the vault room, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_intro_04a">Why do laanie dwankies always host secret parties in old mansions, when it&apos;s raining outside?</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_03_01">That&apos;s it! That&apos;s what we&apos;re looking for. I&apos;m sending the drill now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_11_03">Have you found the access point to the inner sanctum, yet? Look for a nice, sturdy door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_16_any_01">...There&apos;s 1 Gensec security box we need to disable.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_110_03">That&apos;s how you get to the PEOC, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_69_03">You poked out their eyes in the vault area. No more cameras back there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_10_02">There, that might be what you&apos;re looking for.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_01_to_arrival_van">The van is right around the corner. I&apos;ll be there in one minute.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_61_03">Fuck yes, my friends. Okay, the vault is opening again. Good!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_50_02">Someone answer the phone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_50_03">There should be a mechanism or button to open the safe somewhere. See if you can find it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_38_01">There you go! That has to be important.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_07_03">The office has a special lock system. It uses a spoken pass phrase. But I had a special cocaine package smuggled in through a drugs deal. It has a hidden microphone recorder in it. Find this package.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_01a_03">This friend of McKendrick&apos;s sure has the bling, by the looks of it.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_15_02b">Okay, listen up. This one&apos;s tricky. I need to take apart a bike and get some special shit. This means you need to take me to the garage so I can work my magic.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_03_05">There has to be a way inside. Find it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_10_05">Find a terminal, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_47_01">There you go gang, get in there and start hauling the loot to Mr. Blonde&apos;s car.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_83_03">The code begins with a two, according to my source.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_40e_03">Nice, that&apos;s should be it. Go ahead and use it on the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_37_01">Get a drill going on that vault door, yeah? What we need is somewhere inside.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_18_02">I&apos;m hit. But it just grazed me, I&apos;m fine.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_32_03">Can&apos;t leave without the keys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_17_02">Come on, no dallying. Go open that door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_99_01">It uses a lot of juice though, so you gotta hook it up to something.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap02_02a">Hey, guess who you piece of shit! How do you feel?</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_45_02">That&apos;s it, open it up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_82_03">You&apos;ll need a saw to get through there. There&apos;s probably one around there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage3_12_any_01">Cops and SWATs have arrived, be careful!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_28_03">See that vent by the elevator? That&apos;s where you gotta stash the bags.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_57_03">They&apos;ve got some nasty security in place, but they didn&apos;t count on old Locke, yeah? Put a blocker on that keypad to stop the code from cycling.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_02_03">Old blueprints indicated a hatch or something to the next level. See if you can get through it.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_05_01">Yeah! Yeah! Awwwww fuck yeah! Crowd&apos;s fuckin&apos; losing it!</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_14_01">Your limbs must be screaming now. But not as much as if you stop grabbing those safes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_14_any_01">Cops just pulled up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_07_03">Illegal untraceable weapons. This is what Gage is all about.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_39_03">There&apos;s a second can of thermite there. Perhaps you can come back once the first is burning?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_39b_03">There&apos;s part of what we need. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_19_02">Sure there&apos;s gotta be loot in the wagons. Search &apos;em. And any C4 you can scrounge too.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_97_01">Ach, that&apos;s one of the Mark II safe models. We can&apos;t simply blast through it without destroying the contents.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_05_02">Next, we find the room whose vent connects with the security center. We can use that to knock out the guards with sleeping gas. So, we need blueprints. Check the archives.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_11_01">There&apos;s a router box somewhere in the lunchroom. Hook me into it and I&apos;ll open the door..</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_15_02">Here&apos;s the code. 1138. </string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_14_01a">Ah, there is my beautiful merchandise! Take it, Take it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_14_02">Okay crew. Same thing. Get out there, and get the cage built.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_14_01">Let&apos;s get inside, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_17_02">OK, I&apos;ll set these off remotely. Now get back to the storage room. It&apos;s open!</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_20_01">Hey! Wha... did Vlad send you?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_53_02">There&apos;s the beautiful cash. Get bagging it, crew!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_68_01">Cops are trying to stop us. Defend those routers while I work!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_07_any_01">Crack that server door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_20_01">One of the civilians is making a run for it, better keep em&apos; in check!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_35_01">Okay, we&apos;re all set to begin the scanning.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_04_02">There we go - green lights. Let the time lock do it&apos;s thing. I&apos;d love to see the managers face when those doors swing wide open.</string>
	 <string id="bkm_cs1_01_04">Why do they think I give a fuck about their money? Why do they?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_15_04">You&apos;re doing great. Keep smashing!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_139_03">This is where the staff work. Offices, IT, security and so on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_94_03">Check the wine cellar!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_33_03">OK, let&apos;s get that gate! Give it some heat, chop chop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_20_any_09">I&apos;m 100% it is muriatic acid now. Just add it.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_10_any_01">Get the bags here, quick!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_13">Shit!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_02_01">I get back to ship alone. Will contact you with instructions.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_20_02">Throw him down there. No one will find him. I hope.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_54_03">There, good. It&apos;s back up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_intro_a_01">OK, remember, this should stay peaceful. Trade the meth for the info, surplus meth for cash. Easy and clean, walk away without bloodshed. </string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_15_any_02">OK, three!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_26_02">SWATS are breaching in!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_91_01">The garage, friends!</string>
	 <string id="crn_man_02_02">Connected.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_11_01">Alright! Got the code! Start the time lock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_22_02">Good find. But you&apos;ll need more C4. Keep searching.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_26_02">Civilians will have the keycards. Get one, and swipe it at the timelocks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_17_01">Set up the saws around the panic room, two on the second floor and two on the fourth floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_115_02">Ralph just showed himself. Keep you eyes open!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_21_02">...sorry friends, but I had to put it in the sky-rocket out by the construction site... you call them porta-potties, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_56_02">You need to find Taylor&apos;s computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_16_01">That&apos;s it. Now you can get the hell out of there, or head back and snag more Murky loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_12_any_11">OK, keep that smoke to a minimum... Keep going.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_33_01">Ag man, the pump stopped. Maybe it needs more juice?</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_24_01b">Aaaand it&apos;s done! Looks just like new... goodbye, darling... I&apos;ll miss ya... I love you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_11_03">Hurry up and get back to the chopper so we can secure the BCI tech.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_10_02">There&apos;s the alarm. Camera feeds are down. Drill the vaults till you find the turret.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_15_02">There&apos;s two pallets found. Now the third. Come on, beautiful friends. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_15_any_02">Good work! Get back to the cooking. Use the time between waves to find more ingredients.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_15_03">I felt that one here! Now, inside, keep fighting. </string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_30_03">Great, now get into the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_113_01">Oh, that&apos;s a lot of hardware. Have a look at the vault!</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_34_03">Woop!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_08_any_01">OK, while we wait for the money to burn you can open up some of those deposit boxes, what ever we find in there is ours.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_32_04">Hey clowns, the safe - drill it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_79_01">Hurry up, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_36_any_01">Alright, the chopper is on its way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_22_any_03">Let me get the chopper pilot patched in!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_12_02">Did you find the evidence storage yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_71_02">Keep an eye on those sprinklers!</string>
	 <string id="rb22_bph_intro_01e">You would have thought someone like the Dentist could afford a better kept prison to torture people in...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_61_01">Water tanks are empty. Refill them in the bathrooms. Hey, I never promised you glamour.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_92_02">Help him get that door open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_95_02">That&apos;s the managers digit. Serves him right for leaving it lying around.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_08_any_01">This will work as a frame - won&apos;t be fantastic, but we will get paid. Let&apos;s get you out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_13_01">Vault with simultaneous two card reader. Probably 10 second time lock. They must be hiding something tasty.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_03_08">They&apos;re right on top of me people, can&apos;t fucking hold out much longer!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_29_03">Ok, now make your way to the vault, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="plt_mad_03_01">Time is precious comrads. Get those anti-airs down.</string>
	 <string id="rb1_bph_intro_04b">Yeah, it ain&apos;t candy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_21_any_01">Folks! This is gonna cost us but I&apos;ve arranged an escape chopper - a few minutes!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_22_03">The crane has been stopped. You need to restart it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_85_02">Looks like he&apos;s chained to the spot. You need to find some tools!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_159_05">So good to talk to you, sir.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_48_03">There&apos;s your ride out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_60_02">Thermite is our best way into the vault. We&apos;ve done this before.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_37_03">Come on, gang, I can&apos;t detonate the explosives as long as you are close.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_64_02">You can move out of the PEOC now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_13_02">The batch is done, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_68_01">Get out onto the lawn! You&apos;re almost out of time!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_64_02">Now we&apos;re talking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_05_02">You gotta restart the override on that box.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_intro_01_02">Don&apos;t worry Locky, Vlad will be quiet as mouse drinking Sputniks!</string>
	 <string id="bru_run_04_02">Alright, I&apos;m on my way!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_37_02">That&apos;s a strange looking dinges, yeah? Put in on a zipline, chop chop!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_67_03">Look at that! Now stay and make sure it all burns!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_09_01">All right, that&apos;s all I need to keep DC partying! But there&apos;s always Baltimore, Harrisburg, Philly. You keep making, I&apos;ll keep buying and we&apos;ll keep the East Coast dancing, yes? Or you can leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_65_01">Here&apos;s your mask area. Pretty self-explanatory.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_13_01">Good. That&apos;s the first. Now find the second.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_16_01">Time to leave this clusterfuck behind us! Get out of there, NOW!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_12_03">Get to the construction yard! Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_96_03">You need fresh power cells.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_114_03">There&apos;s no doubt they have the pardons locked inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_26_01">Watch out - there&apos;s more of them down there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_14_03">All right. Container 61 is where you need to stash the gold. It&apos;s out in the yard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_03_any_02">I don&apos;t like it... Let&apos;s get this over with as soon as we can, get the paintings on the table. </string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_02_any_02">Alright... OK, we need at least four paintings, remember, the ones with red stickers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_55_02">Don&apos;t stray too long though, friends. I&apos;m seeing a lot of chatter in Murkywater channels. Looks like they&apos;re tracking us.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_12_02">That&apos;s the keycard we needed. Get back to the train and open the door.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_05_01">I watch man eat human shit in Attica. He look just like you. Wait, can it be..?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_35_any_01">Great, Set off the flare so the chopper can land!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_04_03">This car doesn&apos;t have a door, so you&apos;ll have to use a blowtorch to make one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_05_03">Damnit, that&apos;s the alarm. Stay frosty and get ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_20_02">And...</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_56_03">Taylor&apos;s computer should be nearby.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_08_03">Okay, looks like they have two linked locks on this. Find the other lock and get a breaker on it too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_12_05">Remember, find those laptops.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_16_02">Let&apos;s get out of here. After you, please...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_f_05">Wait a second...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_20_02">850 horse power of pure sexy badass.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_05_03">Get the bags to the van!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_64_01">Stop dossing, yeah? Into the office!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_15_02">Good! But it will be a long minute!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_26_03">Perfect, all you got to do now is disconnect the keypad on Garrett&apos;s door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_19_02">Damn it! Those oil barrels are in the way. See if you can release the straps, and do it quickly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_intro_a_03">The info they have will be in a briefcase or something like that. Make the trade and have them hand over the info to you. These guys are scum so keep your eyes open. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_04_01">Used dinars. Hard to trace. Perfect.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_03_01">Can you take the snipers out?!</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_17_03">Nice. But try and keep those tossers off the power, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_cnc_01">Merry christmas, my friends! I need you to help me with a little Christmas miracle.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_06_01">There we go. Hmm... it says there&apos;s physical evidence on our friend around here as well...</string>
	 <string id="plt_run_02_03">I&apos;ll try another spot where it&apos;s less hot. Follow me.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_26_04">You still gotta find that USB stick. Check around the West Wing if you haven&apos;t already. </string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_05_02">There are the safes. How beautiful they are. You will need transport to get them out safely. Look around.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_03b_any_02">... hang in there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_89_03">The code begins with an eight, according to my source.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_intro_a_01b">We need to catch up with the Mendozas before they jet out of this country.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_09_any_08">What&apos;s taking so long!?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_03_02">Jesus, he&apos;s wasted. Stay with him. He&apos;s in no shape to defend himself.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_05_02">You&apos;re breaking up... Can you hear me ok?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_30_01">We&apos;re not leaving this place without some loot. Ernesto has floor safe where he keeps his stuff. Use the winches you picked up earlier, hook them up to the floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_25_03">Crisp and neatly stacked. Don&apos;t be shy, gang. Go get it!</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_intro_01">Okay, time for...honesty. The coke is packed in...goats. Yes, goats. And they&apos;ve escaped. Haha, tricky goats, huh?! Find them!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_37_03">We&apos;re stealing stranger and stranger things, yeah? Hook it onto a zipline.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_02_03">Suck in those guts guys, let&apos;s make a good impression. Go meet the gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_41_03">Crew, get drilling the gate. Hustle it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_91_03">The code begins with a zero, according to my source.</string>
	 <string id="plt_run_09_03">Hurry up! Get him into the chopper so we can get out of here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_83_02">There you go. That&apos;s gonna get you through.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_53_02">Go through that door right there. Twitch is waiting!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_12_01">There&apos;s the balloon. Hey, you see it, guy?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_25_01">Ach, they&apos;ve upgraded from the plans Vlad gave us. Maybe you can find a manual or schematic somewhere around there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_51_01">I have a nice spot, just for those loot bags... right here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_67_01">OK, start up the computer again and let&apos;s pick up where we got interrupted.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_34_02">McKendrick sure has a lot of influential supporters up there. They&apos;re expecting to cash in if he wins, I&apos;m sure.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_06_06">I need covering fire to get the gate open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_intro_01_01">Intel tells us the EMP bomb will be two parts, and that&apos;s what we&apos;re here for. But with that said; if you see an opportunity to grab other valuable loot you should do it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_72_01">You&apos;re going to need two key cards to get in there. How many have you found?</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_26_01">Ah, that&apos;s it friends. A nice little Payday, though I think we could have gotten more!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_46_03">Old Locke knows what to do with those suits.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_end_01_02">You did it. Got a couple of Russian oil playboys that&apos;ll pay over the odds for these wheels. Nicely done!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_31_any_01">Great job, I&apos;m connected.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_78_04">Remember to protect the hacking device!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_44_01">Secure the bags on the plaform where you came in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_09_03">Look out, the room is booby-trapped! Disarm or get out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_23_any_01">They&apos;re deploying SWATs on the roof!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_122_02">Why&apos;re you still searching containers? You got the bomb!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_10_any_02">I have root. There&apos;s two Gensec alarm boxes we need to disable, get to them and cut the wire.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_57_01">What are you waiting for? Get on the ship!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_03_03">Guys, the vault - find it! Check the Murkywater containers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_64_01">Alright, now let&apos;s get out of here. Leave the PEOC!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_53_01">I guess we better do what the little hood rat bastard says. It&apos;s tough to be a criminal in a town as rotten as this.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_05_02">We gotta clear the bollards. I mean you. And by you I mean hey assholes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_11_any_01">OK, maybe tiara is somewhere nearby. Gotta be in the building.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_12_03">...Get to the tech lab, hack into a workstation and see if you can find which shelf the box is in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_50_01">Okay, ping our Inside Guy when you&apos;re ready to de-mask and get out of there. He&apos;ll move the loot, so be sure you secure in the vent what you want to take.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_10_02b">All right, we&apos;re gonna need an engine to get this baby going. I&apos;m almost positive I saw them store some inside the clubhouse.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_30_03">It was a bit of a bumpy ride, but it turned out a-ok. We got the flash drive and the gold as a bonus. It should give you some nice cash to get started again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_105_01">Moretta will be moved to Dock 3B... Once you execute all the necessary steps.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap04_01">Yes?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_70_01">You need to hack the auctioneer&apos;s computer for the code, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_48_04">The mainframe... you should get back to it, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_15_any_01">You guys OK in there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_35_01">Ship&apos;s in position! Going to hit it like Blackbeard!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_30_03">Left!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_76_02">You need to guard the cannon.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_69_04">Head towards the opposite side of the building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_und_03_01">They fell for it. Three transports. Crews are on the street, trying to figure out what&apos;s happening. Hit them hard!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_05_03">Bang, that&apos;s another explosion!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_67_02">But look... the keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_intro_a_01b">Get in, save Hector&apos;s cooks and get the drugs out of there before anything else goes wrong.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_22_03">...you will find it in a dumpster out by the construction site, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_165_03">We got those little pastry balls with the chocolate and cream.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_14_any_01">Keep it moving in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_45_02">Chopper&apos;s nearly there. Just hold on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_115_03">We don&apos;t need BFD breaking down on us, crew. Make sure she has plenty of coolant. Get water from the bathroom.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_53_01">Come on guys, move those bags!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_13_03">That wasn&apos;t the right cell.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_04_01">Cops are here! Brace yourselves!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_119_01">Keep an eye out for Murkys while I&apos;m doing this.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_83a_03">That reinforced door has a date with your saw.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_165_02">Perhaps sir has a sweet tooth? How would you like enough cake to choke a camel?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_17_01">Woah, wait til everyone is in the car!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_13_05">Get those stones to Mr. Blonde.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_16_02">Great. You can safely grab the goat now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_11_03">Thats it! Now let&apos;s get it to work on that vault.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_01_03">Keep listening. Listen for...</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_10_any_02">Hey, the escape chopper is here. If you feel lucky you can go get the rest of the bags - otherwise get out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_20_any_01">Don&apos;t let the workers see you or they might blow the whole deal.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_49_02">Try another key!</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_02_03">About two minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_end_d_02">No cash and no info. I&apos;d call this one a miss. Hector&apos;s going to be very unhappy unless you guys pull my ass out of the fire. I know it&apos;s a lot to ask. </string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_intro_a_01">One more time: sneak in, watch for cameras, guards and any other alarms. Go in fast but careful. Don&apos;t get sloppy.  </string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_14_any_01">50 grand, woah, is there anything left?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_21_03">Good work. That cage is how we move the money out. Start loading it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_29_02">Unless you&apos;re taking more things, it&apos;s time to leave.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_24_02">Head for the roof right away!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_intro_a_01b">Anyway, find the paintings marked as sold and take them. We need at least four to be safe.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_16_01">Where&apos;s he off to? The laundry room? Follow him, you chops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_07_any_02">One minute, one minute people! Shut these guys down! Pick-up&apos;s almost here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_14_03">Get hacking into one of those terminals, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_51_03">The adress is in the wrong district - try another code.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_24_02">The VR set is virtually not here. Or should that be actually? I don&apos;t know - which is it?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_75_01">Ach! Someone stopped the pump. Get it going again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_07_01">That&apos;s it, yeah. Now go find that laptop and hack into it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_51_02">Get to one of the other computers and help.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_10_01">There&apos;s a thermal drill nearby. Go get it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_can_04_03">You heard Vlad. Get those bags into the chimney.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_07_02">The warehouse is where you&apos;re most likely to find a crowbar.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap06_01a">Hello? Make it fast, I&apos;m busy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_end_a_01">OK, we&apos;re off. Tiara goes to Vlad and he&apos;ll get the revenge he wanted. I&apos;m glad we could accommodate him. See you at the safe house. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_17_02">Hey guys.. uuh... it seems we can&apos;t get into Sosa&apos;s office this way. It&apos;s on a separate system.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_38_03">Ah, look. See what that button does, yeah? Maybe the whole place will self destruct? Probably not.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_26_03">Get that keycard in the panel, quick</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_72_02">All his sins burned to ashes! Now let&apos;s find our friend, he should be in the cell block.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_15_01">OK. Nice tech! It appears the panic room door is controlled with a code and a retinal scanner.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_05_01">My old acquaintance in the FBI that owed me a favor has doctored a laptop for you to use. She said she would mark which one on a whiteboard. See if you can find it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_intro_01_02">You know the drill, gang. Let&apos;s cook a little meth.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_05_04">Ohhhh shhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeiiiiiiiiit. Out-fuckin&apos;-standin&apos;!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_13">These guys can drive!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_78_01">Throw the bag on the table.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_70_03">Relight the fire! Come on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_13_03">We got cops all over. Drop the beat, guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_10_03">I was able to get some seismic readings of the area from a local monitoring station. Some areas around the house indicate lots of hidden passages.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_05_03">Ahhh, the safes. My precious little. Bring them safely out. Find a transport.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_30_02">Great. That loot will satisfy our arrangement... however, if you wanted to carry on... I am just saying... hmmmm?</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_13_01b">Okay, we&apos;re gonna need a fancy seat for Rust&apos;s fancy ass, don&apos;t we? There&apos;s an old bunker in the backyard. Get in there and you&apos;ll find what we need.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_05_05">If you put down your guns now, I will be merciful, and only cut off your fingers and toes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_85_03">Now make your way to the West Wing and find the Oval Office!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_kb4_01">You&apos;ve got to keep at least 4 bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_15_any_03">SWAT, SWAT on the balcony!</string>
	 <string id="ope_hb3_01_01">Roger. One moment please. Today&apos;s code is 8394. Please remember it next time. This is very sensitive information.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_72_03">Crap, you just lost a vial.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_02_any_01">Obvious, but the front door is probably not the best move. There&apos;s bound to be better entrances.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_23_02">You heard the man. Bile will deliver the C4 to the rooftop in a couple of minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_30_any_01">Good, now set up the connection again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_15_01">Check the back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_a_07">Okay, what comes after that...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_31_03">We almost tasted that cigar!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_10_any_02">Keep going guys.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_07b_any_03">... hope you guys are prepared!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_13_any_02">They&apos;re inside!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_04_01">Friends, I&apos;m still trying to sort this. Hang in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_19_03">There&apos;s a zip-line set up there. It&apos;s for getting loot out, nice and quiet and unseen. Lot of valuable stuff in there that you can tie on it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_109_01">Damn! All right, that wasn&apos;t the vault. C4 the other spot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_48_02">Every little bit helps, but the rocks in cases are most important.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_53_01">Find the desk of &quot;A. Valentine&quot;.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_44_01">Look at that room go! We god damn did it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_36_02">Have a look around for a ladder, if you want to get up on that roof. And you want to get up on that roof, I assure you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_60_01">Pick up the thermite. That&apos;s our way into the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_31_01">Can&apos;t get out of there on an empty tank. Fuel the plane!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_03_03">Whoops! Take care, my friends. I am not finished with you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_15_03">Okay, there&apos;s a marked closet. Get working on the lock.</string>
	 <string id="csf_cs1_01_03">Hi. I just saw a show, and the bank got robbed, and I want to move my money to a bank that doesn&apos;t get robbed.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_02_05">Where the fuck am I? I see... Storage units?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_04_03">Ah, blerrie. They&apos;ve got those new ultra-fine detectors installed. Got to take a different approach.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_22_01">Gang? I&apos;m not sure you can hear me, but you know what you&apos;re supposed to do: enter the laboratory via the hatchet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_25_02">We need that plane!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_17_02">Keep checking the shipping crates for machines. Once you find them, start the hacking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_09_any_02">Alright, connect me again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_104_02">Chopper is back guys! </string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_45_03">You&apos;ll need to find the right key here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_21_03">Cops incoming. I suggest you head down and take them heads-on by the front entrance. That way you can stop them before they flood the building.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_41_01">OK, our pardons are locked in the vault. Have a closer look.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_09_any_02">Dig in somewhere good!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_03_02">Watch the entrances, friends!</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_02_02">Listen closely. Every single one of those safes needs to be recovered. You can&apos;t let me down on.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_06_any_06">Hey, there&apos;s no room for more!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_12_02">OK, let it work. There&apos;s a police counterstrike on the way. Keep them off it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_11_02">That&apos;s it. Get it to the vault. Lets to this the hard way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_17_02">I&apos;m shutting this down. Make sure you&apos;re with the driver when he bails, or it&apos;s a long walk home.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_61_any_06">Any second now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_04w_02">Get ready for the fourth wave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_04_07">Find the prison trucks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_05_01">The other party is now a minute away.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_55_02">The guards inside will probably have pagers. You should be careful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_26_01">Move quick. Guards will notice that open door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_08_02">Why the hell did some Iraqi dictactor have seventeenth century Swedish masterpieces?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_41_02">Okay, that gas will help secure our escape. Put the can into the container.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_05_09">Everyone feeling good, yes? Anyone with, I don&apos;t know, skin peeling away and showing bone?</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_03_03">Heey! So, we&apos;re dropping cars in the sea, huh? This&apos;ll be fun - just attach the magnet and we&apos;re go!</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_24_any_01">I have to leave!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_85_01">Those chains - you&apos;ll need some tool to get him out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_82_01">Blerrie, what a noise! Time to leave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_02_any_01">OK, the vault&apos;s got the gold. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_19_06">Two keycards. They&apos;ll be there somewhere, I know it. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_25_01">Come on, no need to be nervous. Out of the airlock, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_25_01">Ach, you&apos;re making me go bossies! We couldn&apos;t  afford to lose anyone! Abort and return to the safehouse.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_86_05">You need to kill those cannons. Reactivate the shutdown!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_06_01">You need to get to the cell blocks, right away.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_66_03">Still need more power cells.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_11_03b">When building a custom bike, it&apos;s all about the details, baby. And what&apos;s more bad-ass than a chrome fucking skull? Am I right or am I right? I saw a special made one inside the clubhouse. Get it for me.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_48_03">You gotta take out those bikers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_07_03">OK, your getaway is standing by. Bail now, or use it to clear out the ammo. Your call.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_14_01">Good. Now open the red door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_81_06">Use the zipline to secure the loot.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_92_02">You can either find more loot or get on the chopper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_21_03">Be afraid... Be very afraid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_31_03">Dentist tells me they have C4 in the armory there. Get there, and get it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_intro_02_02">You&apos;re making less sense than usual, yeah?$NL;</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_42_03">What are you waiting for? Set up the bomb.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_02_01">Ok, the first step is to find the head of security - he&apos;ll have a USB stick with access codes for the house. He always wears a green jacket.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_21_03">Cage delivered!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_03_03">Okay, that&apos;s him at the barbecue.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_61_01">There goes the alarm!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_39_03">They don&apos;t suspect a thing. This is great.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_97_02">Time to make a run for it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_11_02">Make sure you don&apos;t raise the alarm though.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_05_02">Chrome skull? Whatever, just do as the mechanic says. Go to the clubhouse and use the blowtorch he gave you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_75_01">Got an idea. I got his phone number. I&apos;ll call him and distract him. You be ready to top up his glass.</string>
	 <string id="btf_cs1_01_04">Roberts Bank is happy to help you, sir.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_64_01">Everyone likes to check on their money, right?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_22_02">Armor of a Shogun. Nabunaga. Thought lost for centuries, but... here it is. Get the pieces bagged.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_intro_a_01b">Then find that money, torch it, and for god&apos;s sake record it with the camera I gave you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_107_03">Take the cooler with you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_59a_02">Remember - the explosion may have scattered the loot across the floor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_60_02">Come on, you need to restart the drill!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_61_03">Alarm is active. They know you&apos;re there now.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_01_06">We should have brought bigger guns,  lads.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_42_02">Those safe deposit boxes might contain a nice bonus. Why not have a look while you&apos;re waiting? Titan doors though, so you can&apos;t just cut them open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_01_any_02">OK folks, my inside man stashed the thermal lance you&apos;re gonna need for the vault around the back. Recon the spot to find it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_72_01">Ach, that vault is not going to open easily!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_70_04">Press the button. You can&apos;t miss it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_21_03">Now use the first card on the terminal in the security room, then the second on the vault keypanel. You got a brief window, so no lollygagging.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_53_any_02">When you&apos;re ready, get to the roof and we&apos;ll get you clear with the zipline.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_48_04">The shaggy goat is unhappy with the knives.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_15_03">You still got your old reflexes, old friend. Quickly, get these bodies out of sight.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_26_01">Found the USB stick yet? It&apos;s gotta be there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_71_05">Quickly now, to the skylight.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_21_01">OK, we got it! Use the code on the panic room!</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_18_any_01">What a fucking waste of quality coke!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_125_02">There she is. The Moretta. No access here, though. Get it to dock 3B.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_09_02">Alright, the alarm is dead. Good job. You can come and go as you like.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_intro_03">OK, friends. You just get to it and old Locke will have you cooking in no time, for sure!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_52_01">It&apos;s on the fourth floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_46_02">Good. Now search the coke bags.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_06_02">Locked. Damn it! Alright, stay cool. Find the manager. Take him hostage. I&apos;m sure he can help us get in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_full_force_02">The cops are pissed that you just bagged their snipers. They&apos;re getting ready to send in the cavalry!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_75_02">The code should be on the screen. Get it and go open the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_29_03">Once you&apos;re ready to bounce, find our Insider. She&apos;s going to help you slip out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_13_03">Just a little longer...</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_02f">Thought you New York guys were all about the bagels, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_29_03">Ok guys, time to leave the tower and get out of here. Move along the bridge!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_03_04">You should see your face! I will see it everyday when it is on my wall.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_03_01">Blerrie! Murky bastards!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_134_01">It&apos;s opening! Now get inside that vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_69_02">Restart the drill, friends.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_25_02b">What you got there? You know what, I really don&apos;t care. Just throw it in the truck and I&apos;ll take it with me as I drive off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_36_03">Once you get that card from Ralph, his dad&apos;s probably gonna disown him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_09_any_03">FBI files... I could stay here all night... Alright I&apos;m on this.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_37_01">And off we go my friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_18_03">I still require one of you poes to swipe the card.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_24_04">C&apos;mon, you&apos;ll get discovered. Go through the computers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_104_01">Attach the car to the chopper!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_131_01">Friends, find the other computer and disable the firewall.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_28_02">Blerrie, the Kataru have really messed him up. </string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_08_06">Excellent, that&apos;s a part in the bag. Bring it back to the mechanic.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_end_01">The owner of this store will have a month of insurance paperwork to do. Nice take boys, back to the house.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58d_03">Come on friends, make your way out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_13_02">Moretta&apos;s comm frequency will be on one of the computers. Check them out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_14">...what&apos;s the worst that could happen, eh?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_97_02">Come on, let&apos;s see what you got.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_09">I can&apos;t believe this shit!</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_02_any_01">Start with putting all the paintings on the table in the train car. I&apos;ll contact you when you are done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_08_01">He&apos;s inside this apartment. Get it open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_05_any_01">Everybody get that!? Three minutes to go till he gets here. Keep them off the coke until then!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_03_02">C&apos;mon guys, find me those security boxes. Check the walls.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_12_any_01">Someone pressed the alarm button.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_15_01">Twitch is coming to the side alley.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_end_01">Thank you. I&apos;m impressed that you showed up so quickly. I&apos;m in your debt.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_15_03">Gang, the C4 is in the van. Get it, and plant it.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_24_01">What are you doing leading him around? Just hit him in the head with a maracas or something and he will talk.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_07_03">The lights are showing your path across the room. You see? Each light corresponds to a tile. Stay on the right tiles!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_03">It&apos;s the cops! They&apos;re following us!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_09_any_01">OK, 3 more then we can get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_47_any_02">You can use a shape charge if you have one. It&apos;s faster than the drill, someone might hear it though.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_155_01">Now, the vault is located down in the Security Center. You have to get down and through there to reach it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_03_any_01">Remember we will need at least four bags of meth.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_07_02">Alright, that&apos;s the van. Get the bags to it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_09_02">Plant the C4 and enjoy the moment.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_42_any_01">Yes! This is the one. I&apos;m sending the helicopter to pick you up! Hang tight!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_34_any_02">We&apos;re looking good... Looking good.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_16_01">Take that tarp off there, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_06_04">Since it&apos;s the season of giving, here&apos;s a little something for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_12_04">Found those laptops yet?</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_26b_05">No one fucks with Vlad&apos;s family except Vlad. They will know, after tonight!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_03_05">Get those doors open! The switch is right there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_20_02">Our guy has a taste for Jaegerheister. Find the green bottle, spike it and serve it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_20_any_01">That&apos;s it, that&apos;s it. Go. Go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_38_03">Still waiting for that drill.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_04e">If anyone finds out what really happened to Elvis, let me know!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_28_03">There might be grates in the sewer, so I left you a little present - some thermal paste. Aren&apos;t I nice to you?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_34_01">Looks like he was hard for the kerels to handle. We&apos;ll need to cut him loose.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_128_01">Leave it with me. I can certainly help you with that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_54_01">You got in and out without attracting notice to yourselves. Gensec won&apos;t be able to discreetly sweep this under the rug. Great work, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_06_02">You know what to do. Signal the chopper, and we&apos;ll drop off more ingredients. Or bail. Your choice.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_17_02b">All right, I&apos;m here. Now cover me.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_23_03">Start searching for that Murkywater nest egg, shaped like a lot of cocaine.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_03_01">Look on the walls for the router boxes.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_02_02">He obviously didn&apos;t care enough about those paintings. You need to find something else.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_22_03">Stand by - sending it in by chopper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_56_01">Guys listen carefully. Once you start making the call, you can&apos;t hang up. He will most likely sound the alarm, he is a paranoid one after all.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_03_08">Are they gone yet? Is it safe to come out?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_24_02">The Velvet Room. Search it for a PC ASAP.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_55_any_04">Guys, I can&apos;t stay much longer!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_01a_01">Wow, this boat is expensive. This Powell guy&apos;s got money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_40_02">Now get that door open. Time to reveal the rat.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_52_01">Look for the name &quot;Taylor&quot; on the desk.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_55_any_02">All this waiting is fucking killing me!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_10_02">I managed to get one of the employees onto our side. They willing to open the gates leading to the vault. Let me put them through.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_11_06">Come on friends, saw those units open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_01d_02">Nice work! The first wave was beaten back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_11_02">The employee lounge has a network router. If you patch me in, I can unlock the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_40_03">Let&apos;s hope that&apos;s what we&apos;re looking for.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_59_03">SWAT are blasting down from the parking lot. Watch it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_09_03">Please remember your fucking jobs - the breaching charges need to be attached to all four locks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_34_01">Now we&apos;re gonna fill the vault door with liquid nitrogen! Mr Blonde?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_76_02">Hurry up and open the vault with the code.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_28_03">There&apos;s a bit of charm in those old vaults, eh? Back then you didn&apos;t need loads of dingeses to get in, just craftsmanship. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_04_03">Bring the laptop to the AA gun. See if you can hook it up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_13_any_02">It&apos;d be wise to find some cover in that warehouse.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_12_01">Umm... help me out with this door, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_153_03">It shares a vent with the Security Center.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_63_any_03">I&apos;m under fire! Help!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_69_05">Keep them off the routers.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_59_any_02">I gotta bust out of here in one minute!</string>
	 <string id="vld_nightclub_debrief_04">Police was hurt and Tasteful is no longer party place. I like your style. Thank you for this and have fun with the money. I think we work together well.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_24_02">There&apos;s a dumpster down there. Gage says you can use it to stash some loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_02_01">You&apos;re going to have to fight your way to the end of the plane, get up the stairs and then fight back along. Only way to reach the cargo controls.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_05_02">This might work. Find a terminal - PC, laptop, whatever - connected to the network there. If I can get into their database, I might just be able to pull some info from a manifest.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_56_03">I guarantee you, that if you hang up while making the call he will sound the alarm. So make sure the coast is clear before starting it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_04_04">Find the prison transports.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_45_02">Ach, you&apos;ve gone and set of the detectors!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_02_02">Hold on...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_36_02">There&apos;s a boat on the lake. A zip-line can get you across.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_28_01">Almost there guys! I&apos;m trying as fast as I can!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_17_02">Everyone! In the car! Now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_59_02">There we go! Now go grab that artifact and move!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_end_a_02">It takes special skills to ninja through a secure warehouse in broad daylight. Great work. Now, let&apos;s see if it was worth it.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_04_03">See if you can find fuel tank and hose somewhere near.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_07_03">Ah, over there! 1965, 4.7 litre V8. Second best thing made that year, yes?</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_13_02b">I fear the main entrance is not an option. They are all over it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_01_03">Slow day... should be good for us.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_06_03">Don&apos;t dawdle, crew. Assemble that cage!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_97_02">Oh, a Jäger Mark II... difficult things to get through without destroying the contents.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_07a_any_05">Almost there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_20_03">That thing has been tampered with. The door might not open while the shrine is missing pieces. Look around and see if you can find them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_06_03">Good. The logisitic officers&apos; controls are right in front of you. Operate them. Let the money go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_49_01">Keep those idiot kerels away from the servers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_29_02">I&apos;m sure glad I ain&apos;t wading through that shit. Locate the exit point.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_32_03">If you don&apos;get moving soon, I think Vlad&apos;s going to go bossies!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_13_any_03">No alarm on that door now. Get inside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_15_04">Find a means to destroy the evidence!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_59_02">They stopped the drill!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_68_02">That was a bang! Most satisfying!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_15_any_01">Someone called the police!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_110_01">Ah, good. That&apos;s the entrance to the PEOC.</string>
	 <string id="loc_wwh_intro_01">Well, I&apos;m sorry to have to do this, but here&apos;s where I clear off. It&apos;s nothing personal!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_15_03">Can&apos;t get a response from the terminal? It&apos;s that damn good-for-nothing Murkywater OS. See if another terminal works better, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="plt_run_10_03">Ok, let&apos;s go. Get in everyone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_16_01">OK, you heard the Captain. Find the computer. Enter the GPS coordinates. Let&apos;s get her moving.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_88_01">One last obstacle before the vault. Lasers. Need to shut them down.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_56b_any_02">... I&apos;ll be back in a moment!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_01_01">Cops are gonna be swarming through here any second! Move fast! Check the wagons for the vault.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_01_02">You&apos;re breaking up... Can you hear me ok?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_71_02">Blerrie, that&apos;s the vault from the blueprints. </string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_19_03">All right, listen up. Here&apos;s the getaway. Get past the bridge up ahead, and you&apos;ll see a truck in a tunnel. That&apos;s Twitch. Just park straight up into the truck, and we can close the book on this one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_57_04">The evidence room is on the second floor!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_18_02">You can throw the loot in the yellow waste chute hanging on the side of the construction tower. I&apos;ll have someone pick it up later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_55_03">Ha! At least you grabbed the money before the bang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_88_02">One more sample in the cooler before you can leave.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_55_any_06">The cops are gonna find me here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_intro_01_00">Hey! Heey! Hey Hey Heeey! Locky!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_und_02_01">The roadblock worked and two transports have stopped. Get to work, and get &apos;em open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_27_01">That hard drive will be perfect! Once you plug it in, I should be able to access their system and get the vault open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_42_01">Hey, how did you do that so quickly, friends? Old Locke almost feels unnecessary...</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_107_02">Dwankie kerels have filled the place with gas! Wait until it clears before going in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_18_02">We need those saws running non-stop, that means keeping an eye open if one of them jams.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_17_02">Gang, ignite the tires. Give that chopper a nice thick smokescreen to worry about!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_29_03">Let&apos;s go blast some doors!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_40_03">Gonna need to call the Moretta, and for that we need the comm frequencies. Search for it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_15_03">Looks like more guards are on the way, so stick some toothpicks in your eyes, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_171_03">Remember to screw that winch down good.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_47_02">The trace indicates West End. So look for a clue for that - West End.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_71_03">You get into that computer yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_64_02">Don&apos;t forget to wipe out any Russian mobsters you find.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_21_03">And... got it! Now, use the code on the panic room door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_36_02">Hey, I got your escape driver coming in by boat. Head over to the small water access area near the river.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_25_any_01">Remember you&apos;re looking for the server room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_102_03">The helicopter is on its way! Just hold on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_05_03">Looks like we need a code for that door. Start looking for a way to find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_09d_01">You&apos;ve defeated the ninth wave of cops!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_51_03">You can&apos;t use the keypad. Time to blow the door open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_11_01">151!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_02_03">It might be a good idea to look around before you go loud. Find your best approach.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_68_01">There&apos;s a cop entering the bank. Here&apos;s an idea: take care of him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_b2_01">...muriatic acid?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_12_any_02">Bingo. The alarm is disabled. Get that door open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_20_01">Alright, the chopper&apos;s on the way. He&apos;ll be there in a minute.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_14_02">In! Right, need a few moments to get the lock. While you&apos;re waiting, head back out and fetch some C4. Let&apos;s get our escape ready.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_01_03">The Payday Gang! Welcome! Let&apos;s teach these guys a lesson, yes?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_129_02">Five!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_54_01">Hah... thought for sure you were going to blow up the room with that one, but no worries. Just one more compound to add.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage3_08_any_02">Oh no! It exploded, watch out! Stay out of that fire!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_04_any_01">Listen up, if you can get me access to the computer in the surveillance room I&apos;ll get it open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_57_01">BFD&apos;s without power. Reconnect the power sockets.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_35_03">Great, now get back and get through that door, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_end_02b_01">Outstanding work. You guys spend blow through some of that cash. I&apos;ll see what I can find on this blueprint.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_06_01">When a door or window opens, the alarm timer will start. You&apos;ll have a limited time to disable it before it goes off.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_21_01">Superb! Everything is proceeding perfectly. Now, please, everybody into the airlock.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_34_01">Are you in the library yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_17_01">You&apos;ve got the keycard, why haven&apos;t you opened the door?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_90_03">Crap. You got merc units surrounding the building. Don&apos;t recognise the logo... looks like a... shark?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_10_03">One of you clowns take that ticket. Easy!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_06_03">Okay, good. Now, take the hostage to the room in the back.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_05_03">Amazing! Outstanding! Shit is being lost down here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_120_01">They&apos;re opening the powerboxes. Make sure they don&apos;t cut the power!</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_06_01">Shit, can&apos;t access the interview files. Need direct approval from the FBI Director himself. Find his office. See if you can fill in for him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_22_01">OK, let&apos;s see here. Got an idea for the code. Find the telephone pole connected to the house. We&apos;re gonna make an interesting phone call.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_05_01">That&apos;s the alarm guys. Watch out for the cops!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_75_01">Murky and the kerels are trying to shut down the cannon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_36_03">Find the bank manager! Black suit, balding. Tie him down - get the keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_03_02">Remember: the bank manager. Get his keycard from him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_28_01">That door breaker is exactly what we need!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_37_01">Refueling is done, so take that hose off. </string>
	 <string id="pln_run_03_03">It looks like the whole area is being flooded by cops. Be careful!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_12_03">The Commissar has a methlab! I know you guys have torched a few labs in the past. Or brew a little magic, if you think got the time and can find a formula.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_52_01">Damn, and shit. The aircrew are sloppy as kak. Helicopter ain&apos;t got no fuel. Hey, can you hook up the fuel line?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_54_01">Gang, get to the computer. Get those coordinates to the ship.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_32_02">The pilot is on his way with the bags. Hold the line!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_49_02">Oh crap, the FBI has Ready Teams in the houses next to the safe house. They&apos;re coming for you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_07_any_02">The display cases are smashable.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_31_01">We bloodied their nose AND got their gold. Great job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_34_01">Connect that cable to hatch and the pick-up. Then start the engine. 400 horsepower and one industrial cable should be enough to tear that hatch right off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_01_03">Driver&apos;s waiting on your signal, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_159_02">Thank you for your time, sir.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_31_02">Plant the last C4 on the roof and we should be good to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_27_03">The helicopter is coming for the tree now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_37_01">That&apos;s probably the server room. Remember where it is.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_49_any_03">Finally, the chopper pilot is heading back to get you guys. Sorry for the hold up.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_12">This is one tail I can&apos;t lose!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_50_01">Excellent, guys. It actually feels nice knowing we did something good. But don&apos;t get any ideas, we&apos;re robbing a bank or something next. </string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_137_01">Alright, now let&apos;s get out of here. Go back through the airlock!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_56_02">Stand by, gang. Moretta&apos;s almost berthed.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_59_01">You&apos;ll find the code inside the auctioneer&apos;s office but to get in, you gotta get the keycard. Find the auctioneer and get it from him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage3_07_any_01">Be careful around that C4 guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_04_any_01">You are looking for muriatic acid, caustic soda and hydrogen chloride.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_30_02">Well I didn&apos;t bring it in. I got it out here in my trunk.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_17">We should&apos;ve fucking switched cars!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_27_03">Drill has been stopped friends, you gotta restart it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_gold_a_intro_a_03">OK, standard bank hit, only we&apos;re going for the gold drop off day. Gotta remain liquid, right?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_10_01">The company that laid the foundation registered a lot of hollow areas on the manifest. Probably means there are hidden passages in there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_01_02">I know it looks like a fortress, but there is a way in. Get to it.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_end_01_01">Great job, my friends. Again, you have served me well. Don&apos;t worry about the nukes. Enjoy your money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_01_02">Using your brain to control a drone? Jesus, I&apos;m getting old. Anyway, this technology is worth a lot of cash, so we need to steal it from these bikers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_23_01">Now top up his glass. Soon as he swallows, well, let&apos;s say he&apos;s going to go loud. Follow him, and get the card for his room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_15_02">Could be he&apos;s got a coffe cup sitting around there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_74_01">Twitch is waiting for you in the basement. Just a short elevator ride, then we all go for a bite, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_27_02">Here we are! See what you can find!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_58_02">There it is! Now drill that door open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_depositbox_a_intro_a_03">You know I love safe deposit jobs. And this one sounds sweet...</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_02_03">Coppers incoming everyone, they found you faster that I thought. Take care of them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_02_02">The wagons would have had a ladder. Look for it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_45_03">Stay focused friends, you&apos;ve set off the alarm!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_requirement_01_bags">Remember guys, we need at least one bag to escape.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_38_01">Now you gotta clear the runway by opening the gates. The Murkys and Cartel dwankies will go bossies, when they realise what we&apos;re doing!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_05_06">Take those guys in the street out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_22_any_01">Cops are here, hold your ground!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_61_01">Gang, you see those plates? I don&apos;t want to be greedy; or yes I do, actually. Why not stick around just a bit and try that printer out? </string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_12_03">I got it? Holy shit, I fucking got it. Ha! Fuck you F.A.A.!!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_53b_any_04">... additional bags would be nice - but not necessary!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_98_06">That cannon&apos;s not going to fire without some juice.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_132_03">Look out friends! They have an active weapons turret!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_46_03">Get another key!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_20_03">Alex will be seen by that helicopter!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_95_05">Get those car keys!</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_03_01">Ok guys, I&apos;m here. So we need to wreck these cars, right? Let&apos;s drop this sucker in the water. Attach the magnet!</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_15_any_05">The getaway just left without you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_70_03">Okay, it&apos;s checking authentication. It might take some time, so keep your eyes on the timer. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_97_02">We got the pit boss&apos; code. Nice.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_f_07">Sorry, that wasn&apos;t right.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_106_02">You&apos;re all done. Get to the roof and signal the chopper if you&apos;re ready to leave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_16_02">A fighting retreat back to the van, guys. Let&apos;s get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_31_01">Get to that pillar - move!</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_04_01">Could be a while. Was it Maryland or Massachussetts Ave?</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_cnc_01_03">We&apos;re going to steal a prototype turret from the Government. Get to the train outside the city, crack it open and get it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_48_01">We know the Commissar is around Foggy Bottom. There must be something there that can narrow it down. Maps, files - anything. </string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_09_any_01">There&apos;s probably some useful info among these files...</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_54_02">Give him a whack over the head!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_08_02">That&apos;s that sneaky bastard dealt with. Let&apos;s finish up fast. He may want more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_18_01">Gas, watch out! Wait for it to dissipate!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_17_02">Get rid of all cops!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_07_03">Friends, get a saw going through one of the doors on this floor, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_88_02">There&apos;s a problem with the Beast. Rust said he fixed it! Get some parts and take care of it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_87_02">Five</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_17_any_01">Now we&apos;re talking! That&apos;s pure profit right there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_78_03">Great, now get into the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_72_02">Hurry up and enter the White House!</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_16_02">The safes are loaded but you&apos;re not. This makes Vlad sad, and sad Vlad&apos;s getting mad!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_11_01">When you find the code, get back to the keypad and give it a go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_32_02">What the..? Power&apos;s out. Get it on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_38_01">Two minutes!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_28">...I&apos;m 57% sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_36_03">Don&apos;t delay, cut him loose!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_intro_03">All right, you&apos;re almost on the 22nd. Get going and don&apos;t get a nose-bleed up there. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_84_01">The code should have a three at the beginning.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_07_02">It landed on flames... That can&apos;t be good.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_07_any_08">Press are going to party on this poor guy. Seems the deal went down in public office too!</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_23_01">Yeah I know the way out. I was keeping my eyes open!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_54_01">Remember, this is a fortified site, expect tough resistance.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_08_01">Nice work, team - the metal detectors are disabled.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_26_03">Haul ass to the pyro booth, guys. Top floor.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_09_01b">Okay, let me think... What do we need? Ah, the workshop. Yes. Go to the workshop, you&apos;ll find the special tools in some toolboxes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_10_02">Grab that ticket at the machine. It&apos;ll open the gate.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_26_01">There&apos;s our mark. Go ahead and end him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_17_03">You gotta get to Mexico. Hurry.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_107_03">Domkops! What are they doing?!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_32_03">OK, now head back to the library. There&apos;s a way into the PEOC there, and the keycard will likely come in handy.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_10_08">Don&apos;t screw the pooch again. Go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_12_01">He&apos;s at the trunk. He um....</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_04_01">Better do what he says.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap01_01">Buluc is fucking paranoid crazy. Has cameras and microphones in every room, just like you said.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_16_03">These are the trucks. When you&apos;re done searching for clues, get the that GPS on the truck you think is carrying the voting machines to Washington.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_06b_any_01">... ready up!</string>
	 <string id="alm_bex_01_01">Hey, Vlad! I&apos;m on my way. Lots of cops around here!</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_end_a_03">I applaud your skills. Punishment came to Ernesto Sosa silently, but with deadly certainty. They will learn to fear The Butcher.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_39_02">Ouch... let&apos;s hope the airbags did their job....</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_77_02">Make sure you protect the pump while it&apos;s running!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_50_01">The thing we&apos;re after is in the middle of that floor. Gotta blow a hole in it with some c4 so we can get it out of there, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_21_02">About half of it is gone already! Push forward, push upward, you gotta get to that coke!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_03_01">Cover the doors! Coppers are there!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_05a_any_03">Arriving in two...</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_31_02">I need a breather. Bain is very heavy, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_more_snipers_deployed_05">Additional snipers are entering the area!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_17_01">The trucks are here somewhere. Vlad&apos;s guys will be too, so watch your fire.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_10_03">The tech is in our hands! Time to head back to the helicopter! Don&apos;t keep Bile waiting.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_16_any_04">They&apos;re blowing the wall!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_24_02">Now plant it on the dock gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_40_01">That&apos;s the head of security. He seems to be in the garden.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_18_01b">Whew, I&apos;m done. I got what I needed. Take me back to the truck.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_10_any_01">Don&apos;t throw anymore, it&apos;s full. Wait for me to unload these first.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_51_01">C&apos;mon, you need to disable the firewall at the other computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_89_01">Great, that&apos;s enough. Now get in the elevator. You gotta get the hell out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_05_02">Free every sailor you can.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_34_01">They&apos;re blocking the road with vans! And... Uh... Heavy units approaching!</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_02">And stay there, you little shit!</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_04_01">Hilary at Gensec here. Routine check in. Can I have the time lock codes?</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_01_02">Jesus, it looked bad on the news, but...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_29_03">Don&apos;t get distracted, guys. Keep an eye out for... Oooh wait, is that from the First Triumvirate?!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_32_02">Doubt any of these books have much value. To us, at least.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_33_02">Are you giving him the earpiece? Good!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_17_03">Find those trucks! And don&apos;t shoot Vlad&apos;s guys if any of them are still around.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_09_01">Nicely done, friends. Now, there&apos;s a security gate you need to get past before you can reach the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_59_02">OK, forget about staying low and quiet. Gimme a moment to think of something.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_31_01">For the sake of a good fuck! You&apos;ve done this already. Just put paste on the grate!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_08_01">Jackpot! Rust&apos;s info was correct. Now, get through the gate and grab the BCI headset and the software.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_40_01">Okay, guys, time to hold the fort until Bile returns. Give &apos;em hell!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_cnc_03">Juicy score in the diamond district, people. Ice for everyone. </string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_02_06">You! Get a move on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_74_02">Great, now see about getting into the building proper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_17_03">Great. Poppa Bain will take care of these. Now, return to the key storage room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_intro_02">Looks like this store is pretty packed with jewels. Everyone getting ready for the holidays I guess. Anyway, I&apos;m looking for at least four bags of jewels.That ought to cover us nicely.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_81_03">Got the code for you...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_12">...this isn&apos;t my specialty, really.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_15_any_01">Throw the bags into the barrels!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_76_02">See those lights? I&apos;m sure they connect to something.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_27_02">Blerrie kerels stopped the drill, you gotta restart it!</string>
	 <string id="pt2_cs1_07_01">One minute. Keep your eyes on the skies.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_71_01">Ok got the callback, everything is clear. Last step. When the timer is done - it&apos;s time to cash in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_36_02">That vault is tough. The drill bit broke. Get a spare part, quick!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_01_01">The convoy is nearly here. Take your positions.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_04_any_01">What!? The Mendoza cartel is still there! Take care of them!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_96_03">Go find a blowtorch to cut through that gate so you can reach the blerrie fertilizer!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_02_01">You know the drill. Watch for guards and cameras. Keep civilians in check. Look around for keycards, and the bank manager - anything that might help.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_56_02">Okay, great! Now stash that loot in the vent by the elevators!</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_08_05">Right wankers, you ready for this one?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_47_03">Another blocker. It&apos;s locked down. Get to the main computer in the server room an hack it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_24_any_01">They&apos;ve deployed snipers. Stay low.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_73_02">The scab-faced meth zombies will rue this day. </string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_40_any_04">Another eight and I&apos;m off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_65_01">Outstanding! Now, get in the limo and end this. Or grab more loot. Your choice.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_07_02">There&apos;s an unusual lock system for Ernesto Sosa&apos;s office, using a spoken pass phrase. But my people have smuggled in a special cocaine package, with a hidden microphone recorder. Find it.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_11_06">You fuckin&apos; see what they did to Brown?!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_09_02">Looks like the Commissar has spent a few roubles on those rooms. Smash &apos;em up! Don&apos;t forget to grab any valuables there too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_107_01">C4 in the armory. Go get it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_102_05">The helicopter won&apos;t be long!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_89_02">Seven</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_dow_04_01">Boom! That couldn&apos;t have gone better. All four trucks are stopped and ready for your attention. At &apos;em, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_30_02">Ok, it&apos;s time to loot Ernesto&apos;s place. He&apos;s got a floor safe in his office. Hook those winches up to the floor and let&apos;s lift it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_21_03">...for some reason, my courier thought it best to hide it in the portable toilets at the construction site nearby.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_48_06">Three flies are on the donkey&apos;s ass.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_81_02">Come on guys, let some sunset into that garage.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_17_01b">Okay, I&apos;m here. Just watch my back while I work!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_62_03">You dwankies! We needed Garrett alive!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_93_01">C&apos;mon friends. Bile doesn&apos;t have a lot of fuel left.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_16">So sodium hydroxide was the same thing... huh, you learn something new every day.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_37_01">Get away from the explosives now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_42_03">Uh, everything is fine. This is the bank. What do you want?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_06_01">Get moving, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_53_03">If you can get into Buluc&apos;s secret meeting room, you will probably find a way to enter Buluc&apos;s office. Nothing is centralized in this place!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_33_03">Yeah, no problem. Not much happening here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_44_02">You gotta get me into that mainframe.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_81_01">Press the button. Open the doors.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_46_03">Someone&apos;s having a bad joke, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_08_03">That was last seen in the Iraqi National Gallery. These guys are shameless.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_42_03">The cops are coming in from the upper floors, you gotta move up and find a bottleneck to defend!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_29_03">Good job, Dallas. You still have it in you. Now, throw the loot in the van and let&apos;s leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_06_to_arrival">The escape will be there in six minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_13_02">Keep the cops off the circuit box. Don&apos;t let them shut it down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_68_01">Now we need to know who&apos;s in this room, steal their keycard. I&apos;ll need a guest list. Download that from a terminal in reception. Grab a USB.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_18_01">That&apos;s it. Now get the hell out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_49_02">That was a bulleye, yes! Now we can fly away and worry not a jot about being followed!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_45_01">The chopper is en-route. Hold on, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_04_03">Job&apos;s done here, guys. Time to roll! Into the car!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_22_03">Pretty much uncrackable without making noise. You gotta find a code to open it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_56_02">Bliksem! Operatives from Murky are in the area. Watch out for them, friends!</string>
	 <string id="sys_hb2_09_02">Evidence locker accessed.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_12_05">Can&apos;t go having that saw there friends, get it off, yeah? </string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_28_05">Come on guys - the briefcase!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_107_03">What are you waiting for, free drinks? Go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_07_01">I can&apos;t believe you&apos;re chasing this guy AGAIN!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_46_01">Gadgets. You can try out whatever you brought over here. </string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_05_01">Guys, it feels like something&apos;s in the air... Money!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_24_02">When the cage is full, let the balloon up. And watch what happens next.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_11">Nah, no... that wasn&apos;t right...</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_17_01">Cool - 25 large. Spend them well.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_02_03">Okay, what&apos;s next...</string>
	 <string id="vld_nightclub_brf_outro_01">Go, men - and get me what I want. The night out has just begun!</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_12_01">Look out for snipers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_28_01">All C4 in place. Get off of the gate now!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_08_02">Are all of the elves dead? Shit. Christmas is cancelled, my friends. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_08_02">This is it. Commissar&apos;s apartment. Get through.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_38_03">Bile&apos;s on his way to you, but he can&apos;t land with those trees in the way. Find a saw, and clear a way for him, then mark it with flares.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_79_03">Those old sewers are a maze. Keep looking for the light, guys. Ignore the stench.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_44_03">These Florida cops don&apos;t mess around. They smashed right through Wilson&apos;s wall!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_39_01">Holy... Have you ever seen anything like it? Get those doors open. Bag it all.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_58_07">You guys know how to fight.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_27_02">The gas will be gone in a while but you gotta decide if you have time to risk it.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_01x_03">Almost there....</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_121_01">You&apos;ve found the bomb. No need to keep checking the bomb cases!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_40_01">It ain&apos;t gonna open itself. Use the keycard and code.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_94_01">That&apos;s the vault, for sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_20_01">Okay. Good. Makes things easier. Tell you what else would make it easier - lighting a flare to guide me in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_h_01">It&apos;s supposed to be caustic soda!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_50_03">Better hurry, kerels have been alerted and are on the way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_02_10">Hope old Locke gets this right...</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_53_01">Plug the server in and connect the power.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_10_to_departure">Escape vehicle is leaving in ten minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_02_any_02">The boss keeps all the earnings in a safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_intro_01">All right, entry point. Synchronize on my mark... mark.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_46_02">I&apos;ll take care of this, just keep watch for Murky chops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_26_03">Remember what I said: don&apos;t kill the guard. Your nonsense won&apos;t trick the Control-Guy again and he&apos;ll sound the alarm.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_31_03">A little free intel from the Dentist - Commissar has a basement safe room. That&apos;s where his prize stash will be. And our best chance of tracking that rat. Find it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_05_03">Superb. The cash is loaded on pallets, which are secured to the deck. Only the logistics officer can release them, and his controls are up above you - you see? To access them, you must get to the stairs at the front of the aircraft, and then return this way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_21_01">They&apos;re here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_85_01">Start the Beast!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_74_03">If you hurry outside and clear the square, I&apos;ve got a little something for you. Time to send in the Beast!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_23_03">See if you can find the X-ray device we need to get the data. Without it we can&apos;t do much.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_07_any_01">Be careful around that C4 guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_15_03">And the code is....1138!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_32_01">They cut the power. Get it back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_95_01">Guys! Get to the boat!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_13_03">Drill´s almost done. Patching through to the pilot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_15_01">Ok, see if you can find that keycard.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_36_01">Hurry, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_31_01">What&apos;s a Gensec truck doing way out there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_04_any_02">OK now, I got you a pick-up driver, patching him through.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_16_03">He&apos;s going for the laundry room. Follow him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_36_any_02">Keep the civilians down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_06_03">You heard him. Get the bags onto the ziplines in the shaft. Get them up to Locke.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_17_02">Into the system. Now just press the button and drop those bollards!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_03_03">Those Murkys can still spot you if you get too close, so be careful, yeah? </string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_09_any_01">That&apos;s one of the external hard drives.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_20_any_03">Out, out, out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_90_01">Just follow the prisoner&apos;s lead, he knows the way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_gold_stage1_brief_03b">Then back to the escape van and bang, we&apos;re rich! Go with grace.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_17_any_01">I&apos;ve marked them for you - get to them, and cut the wire.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_03_01">Looks like we got everything, gang, Your pick-up is on its way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_20_02">That should make things easier. Say, why don&apos;t one of you guys light a flare for me too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_48_08">The metal links were stored with the preserved cucumbers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_60_01">Blow a hole in the wall and get ready to run!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_29_02">Okay, same as before: secure as many bags as you can or leave this place. Make up your mind!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_73_01">Come on, locate the custody cell block!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_16_03">Get ready for another bulldozer!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_15_05">Twitch is coming in from the back lot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_91_02">The van is your way out of there. Get to it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_83_03">Look in the cells and the interrogation rooms.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_05">...unless I&apos;ve missed something...</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_10_03">Nicely done. Leave it to those Overkill dwankies to go over the top with security.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_18_01">God dammit! Another guy, and this one&apos;s watching the server room. I guess you have to take him out as well.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_85_03">I&apos;ve always wondered why I seem to have such bad luck near wildlife. There&apos;s always something trying to bite old Locke... And I do nothing but nice things for the little bastards.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_80_01">Ok, I&apos;m in. Give me a second.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_34_02">Blerrie courier threw the winch parts all around. Sorry, friends but you&apos;ll have to round them up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_12_03">Check the tables, walls, chairs... wherever.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_37_03">Grab as much C4 as you can, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_58_01">Connect that cable to both the hatch and the truck.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_46_03">Take cover! Only a couple more seconds!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_47_01">SWATS coming in from the east!</string>
	 <string id="btf_cs1_01_01">I&apos;ll be happy to help you. One moment, please.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_10_any_01">OK guys, the pick-up driver is here! He&apos;s on the street behind you!</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_07_03">Alright, you&apos;re in. You&apos;ve got access to the PC of the bloody Director of the fuckin&apos; FB bastard I! Approve the request.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_end_b_02">You cleaned the joint out. Now we&apos;ll have perfect coverage in the senator&apos;s apartment. I&apos;ll ensure we get the surveillance equipment in the paintings and set up the trade.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_13_03">Go to the roof and wait for the &quot;choppa&quot;!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_48_03">Get hacking those skylight controls and keep the damn cops off.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_65_03">The plane, friends, the plane!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_91_01">The code should have a zero at the beginning.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_13_02">Stupid bastard hid the coke in a toy box!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_73_03">Power has been cut to the office! You gotta restore it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_13_any_01">45 thousand.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_80_09">Almir&apos;s burgers, what can I get you? </string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_10_03">Couldn&apos;t get a positive ID on who the DNA belongs to, but we got a sample, so that will help. Now, get back to Hoxton.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_07_01">I know it&apos;s not Hollywood glamour, but someone better gets those safes outta there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_44_03">That was a fucking great job, friends. It had it all. Excitement, action - like a movie! And best of all, a happy ending. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_14_01">Careful guys! The wheel stopped on the question marks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_102_01">You have a small army on the - no, wait, you have the Army on its way. The van can&apos;t wait. Hustle!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_67_01">Over there. Your gear&apos;s in that guitar case.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_20_02">The plane will collect the cage from the parking lot, so get these bags there and get building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_10_03">More cops incoming, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_43_03">Okay, the alarm has kicked in a secondary lock on the gate - a magnetic seal. You need a terminal to release that. Let me find one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_67_02">Your car is here friends! I tried to make sure Vlad&apos;s brother-in-law was sober this time, but you know how easy that is, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_03_any_01">Good, you are inside, now, locate the server room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_84_03">Niiiiiiice. It&apos;s lovely, yeah? Get it going and make sure the kerels don&apos;t interfere!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_10_02">Something happened, seems Matt crashed his car. Keep going and you&apos;ll catch up with him!</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_01_01">Keep your eyes open, yes, but especially your ears. </string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_01_03">The Elephant briefed you about the Brain-Computer Interface, right? We&apos;re after a high-tech headset and a software that allows you to control a drone using your brain. Trust me, I can barely believe it myself. Anyhow, according to Rust, both things are currently being transported on this train.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_68_03">Good! Get back to the lot, and start some fires!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_43_03">We might be able to get in by hacking the mainframe and working some of Locke&apos;s old magic.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_88_02">Look for a code that starts with seven.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_43_01">Aweh! There we go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_11_02">Come on, crew - focus! C4 the doors!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_36_03">...you gotta take all those winch parts into the vault room and assemble it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_106_03">Well, it still hasn&apos;t exploded, so you can prep the last ingredient.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_16_01">I think it&apos;s time we leave, don&apos;t you?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_29_01">Great. Now, ready to bail? Just meet our Insider man. She&apos;ll show you the way out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_49_02">Don&apos;t let the federales interrupt the hack.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_43_03">Looks like the tanks are empty.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_04_02">Here&apos;s the deal. I&apos;ll give you the nod, and all you gotta do is hit the button. Got it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_41_02">Good, now hang back while the tanks empty.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_05_01">Now, we gotta find out what room shares a vent with the security center. We&apos;ll use it to knock out the guards. First, get building blueprints. They should be inside the archives.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_intro_04_01">The target is spotted. Just need to get you into position and...</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_08_02">A little C4 will deal with that. I&apos;m sending some now. Hold on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_04b_01">You&apos;re probably looking for a door. Keep searching, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_46_01">Keep an extra eye out for Murkys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_60_03">Don&apos;t tell me you killed him...</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_29_02">Guys. Operate the crane. Get it into position.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_94_01">Vault is opening. Get ready to move!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_05_04">It&apos;s hydrogen chloride.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_42_01">Give him some help with the door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_33_02">Uhuh... uhuh... OK, sure. We&apos;ll have a look.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_62_01">BFD broke down. Gonna need tools to repair it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_08_01">Damn! They have set up an additional security door...</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_114_01">The pardons we are looking for will be inside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_28_02">A door breaker! Perfect!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_79_03">Clear the gate!</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cr2_01_01">Look out below. I&apos;m dropping the package.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_07_03">You need to cover me while open the door !</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_07_03">Wait while I try to hack the security system...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_16_02">That door needs two keycards to open AND has a retinal scanner. Should be easy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_03_01">Gentlemen? The crates with the strobes? Please?</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_intro_01_01">Well, I, I, I am here to help. This shit is too important and I have to make sure you do it right.$NL;</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_36_06">Drag the garden hose all the way down to the shelter</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_105_01">C&apos;mon, restart the hack.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_54_04">Bookshelves are usually good for hiding things, you know.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_25_01">Get into the shelter!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_100_02">Go on, try another key!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_20_02">Good, the EMP is charging again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_57_01">Now get to the ICU. Find and listen to Dr. Schneider, the patient we&apos;re looking for should have blood poisoning and an abnormal heart rate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_03_02">Alright, thats both keycards. Let&apos;s open that vault up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_35_05">You gotta locate the bliksem office!</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_03_02">Hey, is it safe out there yet? It&apos;s smells like old ass in here.</string>
	 <string id="bru_run_01_02">Almost there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_26_01">I know I&apos;m sounding like a broken record, but don&apos;t kill him. You won&apos;t be able to trick the Control-Guy again if you try answering the pager.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_20_03">Blerrie! Bain klopped that Murky good, yeah? Drill through the door and get his keychain!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_01_any_03">Can&apos;t believe we are breaking into the FBI. You guys get inside - quietly. Please.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_60_any_01">I&apos;m going in exactly 30 seconds!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_22_01">OK, Alex will lift it outta there. Let&apos;s not be taken by surprise. Gear up!</string>
	 <string id="btm_cs1_01_03">Good afternoon, ma&apos;am. How can I help you today?</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_03_08">We need to get our hands on the BCI tech, gang. Go forward!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_dfb_04">The bags! Remember to watch those money bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_11_02">And that&apos;s it for the safes. Now I want that truck in the yard. We&apos;re closing this one!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_39_03">I&apos;m keen to meet you all. Please, zipline up the shaft.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_43_03">...A keycard could probably open one.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_05_12">That&apos;s the big question, isn&apos;t it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_14_03">You can throw the bags in the sea and pick them up when we leave. Or take them directly to the motorboat - your choice.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_46_02">So. I will prepare the helicopter. You will deal with the radar dishes. Agreed?</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_44_03">We have a lift-off!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_36_01">I won&apos;t tell you what this is, &apos;cos you&apos;ll fucking shit your undies. Just don&apos;t press any buttons.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_38_03">You gotta get that thing out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_103_06">Keep the people down. Keep them quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_75_03">There&apos;s a manhole there. Use it. Get out through the sewers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_123_03">The system is running an auto-update. Go to the mainframe and stop it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_22_03">I reckon the secret to getting inside Buluc&apos;s office is kept in his secret metting room. See if you can locate it.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_05_any_01">I&apos;m here now. I&apos;m here! Get the bags into the boat.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_47_01">Everybody, get down into the sewers!</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_06_any_01">Great.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_intro_02_04">What driver? What are you talking about, I&apos;m just giving some advice. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_13_01">Hmm.. I wonder what the question mark means.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_73_02">You made too much of a ruckus, the vault is completely locked down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_07_01">OK, the lights in the circuit box corresponds to the tiles. Use them to guide you across. No one can step on a wrong tile or this get&apos;s a whole lot messier!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_36_03">All right now, careful with this. You press the wrong buttons and there&apos;s no telling what you might turn into.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_55_03">...I&apos;m seeing a lot of talk on Murkywater comms, so don&apos;t stay long. They might be wanting to join us, and we don&apos;t want that, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_45_02">That&apos;s it! Now make sure you get out of there alive.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap04_01"> </string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58f_01">Here&apos;s an idea. Buluc has a garage full of cars. Maybe you can use one to take out the turret.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_136_02">This place is legit rich. Let&apos;s make it legit poor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_30_01">That&apos;s the alarm. OK, gang. Plan B. Force our way through.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_86_01">Protect the drill from the kerels.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_98_01">Get that weapon charged, friends.</string>
	 <string id="rb1_bph_intro_03c">Whoever gets to Kento first, pays for the drinks.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_07_03">Please, leave the charges at the door, my friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_49_01">Hurry! Hurry! To the left!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_44_04">C&apos;mon friends, hack the mainframe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_28_01">They&apos;re blasting the train doors with demo charges. They really don&apos;t want you guys in there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_59_03">Now just let the timelock run down, dear friends. It will be worth it, I promise.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_71_03">No need to be quiet now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_67_03">The cops will go all out to stop us here. Show &apos;em what we do.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_04_09">Soda. Caustic soda.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_30_01">There. Hmm, that&apos;s the new Yaeger model K. No way to get into in fast without the code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_02_03">The vault will be packed for transport, so check those Murky shipping containers.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_32_02">Listen...I need you to make me a big bang.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_74_05">Pull that lever!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_end_a_02">That&apos;s all the coke, nice and secure. Even for you, that was a hell of a win! Let&apos;s get the stuff to the boat so we can get our payday on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_72_02">OK gang, time to find that keycard. Birthday Boy is probably still around, so go find him!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_65_02">Quickly friends, grab the box.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_19_03">When the reboot has reached zero it should start the normal timer again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_32_02">Bingo! Steel reinforced hatch. I&apos;ve got an idea. Bile will close on your position. Get ready to fetch your present.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_106_01">That&apos;s it. Get up to the roof and light a flare to signal pickup. </string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_95_03">Did you find the car keys?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_10_03">The dropzone will be long gone if you don&apos;t hurry. Jump!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_03_02">Thats him! Drop him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_end_c_01">Those backstabbing... Well you showed them turnaround&apos;s generally very bad for whoever we turn around on. </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_81_03">Crash a pool party. Get paid. Not bad at all.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_38_03">The nitro tanks need to be mounted to the vault door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_08_02">A katspoegie of muriatic acid!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_12_any_02">I can&apos;t stay for long!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_43_01">Good choice, gang. It&apos;s all about the payday when it comes down to it. You know the drill, keep scanning them bodies for more data.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_51_01">That can&apos;t be the right adress, try again with another one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_30_any_02">Alright, connect me again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_14_01">Looks like that got it done. Nice, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_und_01_01">Must be that drivers first day. The dumbass stopped for the ambulance! Now it&apos;s your turn, gang. Get out there and do your job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_24_01">Damn! They must have filled the room with gas the second we entered the lab. Find out where it&apos;s dispensed from and shut it off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_09_01">That&apos;s all we need but feel free to stick around for more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_intro_01_01">The Commissar is dug in tight as a tick. This is one of his operations. Wreak havoc. If you can smash this dump up enough, he should give us a call. Then I can trace him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_41_01">I know this is elementary for you, but practice is practice, right?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_30_01">So the plan is this, drill a hole through the top of the safe, get a garden hose to fill the safe with water and drop some C4 inside. After that you take what&apos;s inside the safe and escape. Let&apos;s roll.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_08_08">We got them. Thank you, my guardian angels.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_118_03">Dinner time, little fishies.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_53_01">Get some sentries up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_10_03">Chavez won&apos;t have any use for that coke anymore, so take it if you want.</string>
	 <string id="pln_misc_sj_dgh_02_02">Damn! You weren&apos;t supposed to kill one of them, guys... Wick wanted to have a &quot;chat&quot; with them himself. Guess one of &apos;em will have to do. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_06_05">Come on guys, find the whiteboard already, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_11_02">You have to take the snipers out. I&apos;m stuck here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_24_03">Still no power to the crane?</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_cash_cnc_05">Another day, another bank. We can liberate some cash, I&apos;m sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_35_03">Groot, it worked!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_14_01">Great! Now keep the cops away from there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_26_03">Keep looking for the USB stick, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_22_02">This whole enterprise will be for nothing if you dont get that time lock tick-tocking again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_14_any_01">That&apos;s the Mendozas plane, it just left. Guns should be in the hangar now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_08_03">One down, three to go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_11_any_01">A civilian escaped, must have called the cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_39_02">Plane is coming in hot. He&apos;ll collect from the roof. Make sure everything is ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_11_any_01">OK. Got a breather. Jesus. Good work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_10_02">Nothing some meds can&apos;t fix. Pick up the cocaine now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_102_02">Guard is down. That&apos;s the cameras out of action.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_19_01">Once the reboot is over we should be back on track!</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_08_01">You need a pass phrase when you call Ernesto Sosa. The phrase should be on there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_27_01">Gentlemen... Welcome to your safe house.</string>
	 <string id="pln_misc_sj_dgh_05_03">Don&apos;t let them leave! Make sure they stay by the van so we can bring them with us when we leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_21_any_03">There goes the block. FBI SWAT is going to be here in a minute. Get in!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_53_02">Looks this won&apos;t be so quiet after all.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_32_01">You got a new contact. His name is Vlad. Look him up on Crime.net and let&apos;s see what he can set us up with.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_29_02">Ahhh, do my ears deceive me or is that the sound of a titanium vault opening. Maintain your efforts, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_127_01">I&apos;ll get right onto that.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_62_any_05">OK, busting out of here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_100_02">Don&apos;t let the Murky keks muck about with the drill!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_24_03">Damn it! The bastards have filled the room with gas to stop us. Gang, be quick and find a way to shut it off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_19_any_01">2 remaining.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_01_01">No need for tip-toeing now. I&apos;m sending the drill.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_32_03">Bravo, my friends! Now, to proceed, please attach the bags to the cables in the large vertical shaft. I am at the top, and will receive them safely.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_15_any_01">...There&apos;s 2 Gensec security boxes we need to disable.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_01_01">Welcome to Russia, gang! Nice welcoming party, right? </string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_01_01">Locky, Locky, Locky!</string>
	 <string id="geo_glc_01_01">I&apos;ll be there in a couple of minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_80_08">Mr. Sturr&apos;s office, how can I help you? </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_89_01">Get drilling those containers!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_17_03">Right, that&apos;s probably it. Take a print off it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_78_01">Right, now just let it fill up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_39_02">...Now start up the winch. And keep the coppers away from it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_05_01">Three more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_19_01">The mercenaries interrupted the EMP charge! Every time that happens, the EMP is slowly discharged!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_11">Aaaargh!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_intro_a_01c">Hector wants proof we didn&apos;t just swipe the cash.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_41_06">Thy Lord Locke giveth one commandment... find the right combination, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_54a_any_02">Every single one of them! Great!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_intro_01_01a">More money in our pockets and it should also win us some favor with Locke.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_12_any_02">The rail way bridge! They are coming in from the railway bridge, keep them away.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_139_02">You gotta stop those anti-air batteries!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_41_03">Get him out of the car fast, then get to the transfer room on floor three. </string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_13_01">There&apos;s the chopper, gang. Get to it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_intro_01_03">All right, guys. Here&apos;s Locke... Be careful up there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_08_03">That should have been muriatic acid!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_03_01">Good spot. Now we wait.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_22_03">Don&apos;t let the coppers take back the hostage.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_15_03">I think we will come out of this alive after all! Of course, I never doubted it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_61_01">Don&apos;t kill him now. All will be in vain!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_42_05">Hector was the rat!? What a piece of shit who thought he&apos;d be able to take us out. We helped him back to power and he tried to screw us over. What a filthy rat.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_26_02">It&apos;s all going up in smoke. This should get his attention.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_11_03">There must be a keycard somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_08">I thought we lost that damn helicopter in the tunnel!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_48_01">OK, now get going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_07_02">This whole scenario is just too familiar.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_25_02">Put a call through to Fed Central. And let me do the talking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_16_01">There must be a used cup around there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_18_01">Hold them off until we get that footage.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_16_04">Wonder how many donut chompers just shit their duty blues.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_15_04">Get to the parking lot and meet up with Twitch, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_119_01">All right, that&apos;s it! Throw it up onto BFD.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_33_01">Excellent. That&apos;s enough for the roof.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_12_03">OK, the door is locked. We&apos;re gonna need a key. I think finding Chavez will mean finding the key. So search the building for Chavez.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_12_01">Damn, the door is locked. It&apos;s Chavez&apos; joint, so he must have a key. See if you can find him higher up in the building.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_02_07">Or what?! Are you two gonna make an old man wait for the next one?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_67_01">Uh... Gang... Elevators are on the move. Expect company.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_01_10">Bain, old time river here has been talking so I didn&apos;t quite catch that, but let&apos;s go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_155_02">You&apos;ll find the vault down in The Grin&apos;s Security Center. Head there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_32_any_01">They didn&apos;t even see us coming. Great work! See you at the safe house.</string>
	 <string id="plt_run_08_02">I&apos;m over here, guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_03_03">Hit the cargo door switch, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cs1_17_01">Danny Boy has the package. Repeat: Danny Boy has the package. Over and out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_31_03">Probably a good idea to throw that dinges on the conveyor belt in the main hub- let the machines carry it back to the entrance for you, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="sys_hb2_11_02">Positive match.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_22a_03">How&apos;s it going, Alex? Get a grip!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_03">I guess that wasn&apos;t it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_26_02">Now go sack that armory, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_45_01">You found a second vault?</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_11_any_03">Plenty for Vlad - is it enough for us? Your call.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_26_02">You need to be at the pyro booth. It&apos;s on the top floor - get there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_01_any_02">OK, that&apos;s the clubhouse. Bikers&apos; got the address we need. Sneak in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_09_02">It should be caustic soda!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_82_02">Have a look around and see if you can find a saw to use on that barrier.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrasch_stage1_end_b_02">I think you just wiped out everything. All of it. The farm. Well done.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_03_any_03">Perfect!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_16_02">VR headset. Find it, that&apos;s where the coke is! Check the electronics store!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_22_01">Aw man, it&apos;s almost all gone. All gone! Please, try to get a least a little!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_07_02">See if you can find Buluc&apos;s office. He apparently spends a lot of time in there, so it&apos;s a solid bet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_20_01">Those cameras won&apos;t be a problem anymore!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_05_02">Alright. Now for the mansion. It&apos;s a safe house for a reason, and expect alarms on all the doors and windows.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_05_03">Gotta get them goats back quickly. Use the car!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_35_01">Nice, I&apos;ll detonate these. You just be ready with the cars.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_intro_01">Help me get the goats into the barn.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_39_02">There&apos;s two cans of thermite there. Maybe you can come back later?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_17_02">Now, the keycard I left for you. That large door has two security stages, and an airlock beyond. The first is using the keycard. So...</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_78_04">Just keep running!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_23_02">The Murky resources we&apos;ve gotta find will be in the form of drugs. They could be anywhere around here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_16_01">We got what we need to get through the gate. Now, meet with the Insider.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_26_02">Halfway done, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_51_any_03">Almost! Almost, almost...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_43_any_04">Aw, no! The metal detector is new!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_14_01">Come one friends, that&apos;s not Bain. Open the right one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_09_03">Take the C4, crew. That will deal with the construction yard wall.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_end_b_01">I believe the Sosa Cartel may now be regretting their decision to try to intimidate me. Their Miami operation now lies in ruins, and I can do business in peace again. Thank you for delivering my message.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_12_any_02">Amp it up guys - more!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_80_01">Ach, you gotta get into that thing somehow. Wasn&apos;t really prepared for that.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_01_03">Here we go, friends. This one&apos;s for Bain, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_28_01">You can use any laptop to extract the information.</string>
	 <string id="bru_run_02_01">ARGH! They got me! I&apos;m shot, I&apos;m shot!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_95_01">How difficult is it to find some fertilizer?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_07w_01">Ok, here comes the seventh wave!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_13_05">What are you doing? You should be looking for Garrett&apos;s office.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_31_01">They might have moved him from a cell to an interrogation room.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_05_02">Ah bollocks. Server&apos;s encrypted up the arse. The code keys should in the Security Office. Get over there, grab &apos;em and get them back here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_15_04">You got more guards incoming, so no dozing off.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_08_03">California is sinking into the Pacific. And those safes don&apos;t float.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_17_02">You remember when we hauled the samurai armor out of here? Ahhh, good times!</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_03_14">Be my guest!</string>
	 <string id="plt_as1_intro_01_02">Here&apos;s the dropzone. Stand by!</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_end_a_02">They will wonder how this happened, but they will know who did it. And they will learn not to fuck with me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_34_02">The roof is about to collapse!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_44_01">Purring like a kitten. A 400 brake horsepower kitten. Good job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_31_03">That&apos;s it, gang, just the roof left now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_16_02">Vault looks packed with cash. It&apos;s your call on how much you can get away with.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_36_02">That&apos;s a full load. Hang tight. The chopper will be back.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_100_03">See if you can find the right key!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_70_07">C&apos;mon friends. It&apos;ll be fun. Blast that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_16_01">Ok, that&apos;s great. Now for that server... If you get back to that laptop and hook me up, I should be able to open the room where the server is.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_08_02">Look for the valves. Get the sprinklers going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_15_02">The main gate. Direct route, but might be watched. Maybe there&apos;re other ways in.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_11_any_02">Hector is going to kill you!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_79_03">Kerels will be coming soon.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_54_02">Maybe there&apos;s something hidden among the books in the bookshelf.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_03_03">I will hold you to that, you chop!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_22_03">There you go, it will start now!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_01_03">Who sent you? Wait, don&apos;t tell me. I will enjoy extracting it from you. As I will enjoy extracting your fingernails.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_64_03">There&apos;s a boat ready for you. Head there.        </string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_13_03">You can secure the bags down in the motorboat.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_end_02_02">That was messy but sometimes, it gets messy. But you ended up on top. That&apos;s what&apos;s important. Great work!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_08_02">Dallas! The cops are here, you know what to do!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_55_01">OK, that&apos;s it. Time to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_65_03">Great work, crew! It got a little messy, but you finished it like pros!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_135_02">Hot damn! You&apos;re on a hot streak!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_end_03_02">You just ensured yourselves a place in the history books, gang. Simply outstanding!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_04_01a">They should have some kind of panels on the side.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_60_05">Take the box and get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_20_03">It&apos;d be easier for Bile to pick you up if you go to the top of the overpass.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_06_any_01">This is your standard jewelry store knockover. If there is such a thing.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_69_03">It&apos;s charged and ready. Press the fire button and stand back, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_32_01">The armory. Looks like they&apos;ve a bunch of C4 stacked there. Christ knows what a casino needs plastic explosive for...</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_17_02">I can&apos;t work out how it...</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_04_01">One of the routers is probably real close.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_70_01">Listen! That vault contains the prototype. It&apos;s in one of the crates. The others are decoys..</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_46_01">Use the winch chain. Hook it up to the gate!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_07_02">Great. Now, get to lock picking that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_50_03">Got it. 836084.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_71_06">What&apos;s wrong with you chops? Too much to drink last night? Get moving!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_07_01">You&apos;re done? Good. Now keep going.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_24_02">Ok! Now find a gas can and shoot it to set it all alight. Let&apos;s burn some art!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_04_any_02">We need chemicals to cook. Muriatic acid, caustic soda and hydrogen chloride. Easy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_03_any_03">You need to signal the boat driver with the floodlight in the warehouse. It&apos;s the only way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_17_01">Good job. You sealed off one of the entrances. That should make it easier to defend.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_33_05">Yeah, the uh... monitor here just broke. Made a lot of noise. Scared an old lady but the janitor took care of her.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_35_03">Get aboard, dear friends! That was fucking beautifully done! </string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_03b_any_03">... keep cool!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_43_01">There we go! Just like one of those Russian doll-things. Take the box and keep it safe.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_37_03">Don&apos;t forget to check the roofs of the buildings. Look for a ladder. </string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_85_03">We&apos;re stealing stranger and stranger things, yeah? Take the dinges, quickly!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_54b_any_03">... you guys really ARE the PAYDAY gang!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_40_03">How are you coming along with that winch, friends?</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_05_02">Alright I&apos;m in! *whistles, impressed* These guys aren&apos;t messing around. Lots of additional firewalls.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_07_07">Man, I could really use a beer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_53_02">Now fire up the winch! Keep the cops off it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_141_01">OK, I&apos;m back! Get on board the chopper!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_21_01b">Oh, this is gonna be fan-fucking-tastic! Get me the next part!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_10_02">You got it. Excellent. Time to bring it all to the helicopter. Bile&apos;s waiting, get going!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_15_03">Get to the West Wing, the gate should be open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_61_03">Feed the Fed, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_03_02">Grab that C4 in the limo and let&apos;s blow this place. Hurry! Cops are coming.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_22_01">I&apos;m almost done here. There&apos;s gonna be a lot of information to dig through back at the safe house, but we&apos;re gonna find that fucking informant, and nail the twat before he rats you all out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_art_intro_01_02">We did it once, we can do it again. Get in there, and boost that art, clowns.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_19_any_03">Seven bags!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_27_05">See what useful items you can find!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_10_05">No, it&apos;s chloride, hydrogen chloride.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_30_03">We can scratch the Captain moving his ship for us now. Nevermind. We can move the ship without him. Hack into the ship control terminal. And don&apos;t let the cops interfere with it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_10_any_01">This place is dry, get back to the van.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_29_02">Hey, that&apos;s a Franz-Jaeger Safe. This is unexpected. Well, only one way to crack it with the time we got. Water pressure!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_24_02">Friends! I am here and in position! Please, when the opportunity allows, take the straps and attach them to that wonderful stack of money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_08_02">You thought you were just going to stroll in through the main entrance? Look around for another way in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_06_any_01">That&apos;s his phone. Good.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_08_01">We&apos;re doin&apos; this shit for a fucking book?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_38_01">You got to him in time, but someone&apos;s going to notice him missing eventually. Work quickly!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_84_02">Guys, don&apos;t forget to get that terminal back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_end_01b_01">Great job. I&apos;ll get my contacts fencing the shinies. And see what I can find out about that blueprint. Stay tuned.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_51_02">If you need more c4, take a look in the stash outside again, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_05_03">The message has been delivered. Ernesto Sosa is dead. Your work here is done.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_53_02">Ach, piece of kek dinges!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_28_03">The briefcase! Don&apos;t leave it behind!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_84_01">Now start it up. And keep the kerels away!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage2_09_any_01b">They&apos;ll likely try to destroy the intel if things get heated.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_60_01">There&apos;s the AA gun. Blowing this up would mean blowing ourselves up. We need to hack it, get me access to that laptop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_88_02">Thanks to that manifest you found, we know where to drill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_42_01">The plane is close. Mark the landing strip with flares.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_79_01">Heads-up you chops! Incoming Delivery!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_intro_01">OK, time for the hit. You might see some Garnet things in there too - I like seeing they&apos;re still in business after all we&apos;ve done to them. I need at least two bags to make this worth our while.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_09_03">Pump has stopped. Please check it-</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_79_01">Hmmm... He can&apos;t be in here... Neither there...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_71_02">Monitoring their comms - no-one suspects a thing. Now get to the computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_30_02">Search the office! Get the guys name! Not much time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_62_01">There&apos;s millions of files here and they&apos;re all encrypted. Get him talking again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_07_01">You will go in through the ground floor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_37_03">Look out for the lasers! You&apos;re probably going to have to disable them via the roof of the building. Do some lucha libre moves and get up there, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_128_03">These systems have one major weakness- they&apos;re easily susceptible to malware, so I&apos;m going to give them some.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_48_01">Give &apos;em a whirl.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_32_01">Keep moving - get down to the garage.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_21_02">Uh, I&apos;m seeing a couple of 911&apos;s called in from that location. Brace yourselves!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_03_01">Muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_04_03">Any coke you guys find, just toss it in the helicopter. I pay big bucks.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap07_01b">Please, may I have your attention. Due to the arrival of some troublesome guests, I cannot guarantee your safety and we must end our evening prematurely. If you will please make your way home, I promise we will have a new gathering soon. Thank you for coming tonight! </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_41_03">Right, now stay quiet and collect all of Vlad&apos;s &quot;precious&quot; loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_50_02">Team, you should consider yourselves besieged. They got you surrounded and are setting up snipers. I would stay inside if I were you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_07_03">You heard what Locke said, guys. Into the boat and let&apos;s get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_02_03">I think we need to get into the prison.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_25_any_01">The cops are doubling down...</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_12_any_01">Bam, that&apos;s the doors, I&apos;m still working on the paintings.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_53b_any_03">... anything more than this is just bonus!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_04_01">Get this shit open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_13_03">Get the prisoner out first, then you can go for the cash.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_21_02">Cops have messed with the time lock. Restart it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_75_03">You should now be able to see the code. Get it and go open the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_14_01">I&apos;m in. Need some time to open that lock. Instead of sitting there scratching your ass, head out to the van and get some C4. Time to prepare your escape.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_31_03">That worked perfectly. Take the keycard and go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_16_any_01">We are going to need ingredients, so scout the place and see what you can find.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_08_05">Laptops... can be very useful but you got to... find them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage3_11_any_01">I hear the cop radio, law enforcers are on the way, they arrive in 30 seconds.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_04_03">Don&apos;t forget, dear friends - you need to open the cargo bay doors.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_21_01">Have you found all the missing pieces yet? Check the shrine for clues.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_103_02">And that&apos;s the guards dealt with. Cameras are no longer a problem.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_07_05">Saw them open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_16_03">Guys, the wreckage is incredible. Rubble blocking everything.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_99_01">Guys!... Guys! You still there?! Get... -out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_94_03">Right there on the feed... that&apos;s the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_11_03">That&apos;s the last one opened! Check it!</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_end_b_02">The Sosa&apos;s Miami operation is fucked. I don&apos;t think they will be giving me more problems. Thanks to you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_21_03">Aha! The Moretta comm frequencies. We can use these later, but stay focused.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_62_01">OK, forget the window cleaning platform, you&apos;re going to have to use ziplines to move the bags out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_67_03">It&apos;s easy. Just choose a vault, and press the button. That will start the timelock, and the vault will open. Abracadabra!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_74_02">Find the guest so we can steal his keycard. Remember, he&apos;s likely on the slots.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_30_01">Pass by the Amber Room when you get a chance and have a look at the computer there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_87_03">Go on, free the prisoner!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_28_01">Guys! You need to get that briefcase!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_02_02">Break the cases to get to the goods!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_47_02">Time to leave, gang! Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_06_02">You could probably get some good covering fire going from one of those roof tops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_16_03">The door required has a keycard lock, and a retinal scanner. Jeez.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_05_03">The items, friends. Collecting them is a bother, I know, but necessary to this operation.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_18_any_01">It feels bad to leave the gold, but we will get paid. Maybe we can return.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_04a_02">What a lotta kakspul, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_06_any_01">That&apos;s the door, looks like the alarm is already off, get it open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_17_01">Damn it, gang! You have less than a minute now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_45_02">That&apos;s it for the seal. Now keep an eye on the drill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_101_03">Cops are through the front gate. Get ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_26_02">The vault&apos;s open and ready for you, gang. Just grab that loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_12_01">I heard the blade cut through. Get that door open!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_25_03">Friends, you&apos;re going to need to bring that drill into the vault room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_50_03">Tap into the security boxes.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_04_04">You fuck with me? I fuck you! You!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_85_02">OK, time to get in that vault, chop chop.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_65_02">Well, I&apos;ll be a donkeys uncle - empty fucking vault! Only open the good ones, yeah? For sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_82_02">Zero</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_03_07">You are like great American comedians. Yes, again! More!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_25_02">Get Hox outta there! Up to the street! Move it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_47_03">OK, you chops! Watch out for flying brickwork...</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_04_01">OK, looks like they&apos;ve upgraded not too long ago. Makes this a little bit harder.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_08_01">Thank you. That was getting a little... uncomfortable.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_16_02">They&apos;re not getting in that way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_51_02">One more and you&apos;re done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_intro_01_03">Daddy needs a new pair of shoes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_25_06">Make sure you don&apos;t leave Charon behind!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_40_04">Why haven&apos;t you found all the components yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_07_03">Get past the gates, but don&apos;t get spotted.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_21_03">Just the last bag to go, guys. Don&apos;t mess up now.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_09_03">Each one will bring a King&apos;s ransom. That&apos;s literally true (laughs)!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_39_01">Nice. Scoop that loot up quickly. Let&apos;s get out of here before they notice.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_97_01">Probably worth a fortune.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_62_02">Blerrie! This whole operation just went to kak!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_13_02b">Okay, listen up - there&apos;s a bunker in the backyard, yeah? Don&apos;t ask me why. Get in there, and you&apos;ll find a fancy lookin&apos; seat.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_28_01">Don&apos;t enter the wrong code or the alarm will sound.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_04_01">What&apos;s a Gensec truck doing way out there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_end_b_02">Look like you are heavily loaded - that was all the guns right? I&apos;ll have to make it harder next time. Maybe wear a blindfold or something. Well done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_a_08">Uh... mhm...</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_08_02">Yes, good...picking up telemetry from the money now. Right on target. Oh, why don&apos;t you grab those parachutes there.</string>
	 <string id="pt2_cs1_17_02">Yeehaw! I got ya cage, ya hear me? I got it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_03_04">Yes, good - now open the doors. The switch there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_16_01">Our bird will be near the train yard any moment. Be ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_11_03">Great. That&apos;s what we came for. I&apos;m sending your getaway. Just stay alive a little longer.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_48_02">Locate the server room and start hacking!</string>
	 <string id="pln_misc_sj_dgh_05_01">Hey! Don&apos;t let them get away! Keep them by the van!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_27_03">I can&apos;t shoot Murkys and carry Bain at the same time. You gotta take them out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_08_01">You need to find the laptop, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_18_02">You&apos;ll never carry those out. Gonna need a transport, and a way out. Give me a minute, I&apos;ll find something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_overpass_swat_heli_incoming_01">The cops have sent in a chopper carrying heavy SWATs. You better be ready when it arrives.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_03_any_01">Damn it! That&apos;s the alarm!</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_08_07">I want those safes out of here. What if there is an aftershock? </string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_24_03">And that&apos;s the last of it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_41_02">Winch has been stopped by kerels! Restart it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_01_any_03">OK... You&apos;re gonna need a thermal drill for this gig... My guy stashed it around the back of the bank. Get it and get to work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_41_02">Clear the path. Clear the trees!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_10">...it has gotta be.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_14_03">Did you find it yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_14_03">Alright. Fine work, clowns. Bring the footage back and we can close out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_chopper_arrived_02">The chopper&apos;s ready. Watch out! Those snipers dont want you to leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_07_01">I&apos;m looking at the manager&apos;s file. Chances are he&apos;s wearing a black suit.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_65_01">Come on, get to the boat.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_07_02">Bastards were just waiting. I&apos;ll have a backup plan in a minute.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_82_any_01">Listen up. Police are closing in. They are here in 20 seconds.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_08_01">That thermite you picked up before should work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_17_01">Open the door to the back office!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_05_03">The bypass needs to be restarted, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_10_02">Get that shoe box people!</string>
	 <string id="plt_run_06_01">Damn, this ain&apos;t working. I&apos;m gonna have to fall back a bit.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_73_02">We got what we came for, so you can get out whenever you are ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_11_01">Great job! I&apos;m sending the van, keep looting!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_cnc_03">Time to get those tonsils checked guys. We&apos;re going to Mercy Hospital.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_71_02">The concentration in that sample wasn&apos;t even close. You need to go again.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_20_03">Coming around again. Going to leave this on the road for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_art_end_01_02">Expertly done! Collectors will pay big figures for this stuff. You did great, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_16_02">Another closet. Great. That lock won&apos;t give you problems.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_04_05">You fucked with the wrong Russian tonight, my masked friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_13_any_02">Forest - cops coming through.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_21_01">Nice! Comm frequencies for the Moretta. This will be useful later on, but stay focused.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_05_03">I&apos;m a bit worried our intel on the Murkys is bad.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_54_03">Winch isn&apos;t working, crew. Fix it!</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_07_01">Hook it up guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_63_01">No need to take risks with this stuff. Just put it on the floor and burn it right here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_21_02">Keep looking friends. Check the shrine for clues. You need to find those pieces.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_57_02">Ok, drop the C4 into the safe and blow it open, the water will do the trick.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_50_03">Thermite should be half-way through by now. You&apos;re doing great.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_cafe_01_to_departure_01">You&apos;ve only got one more minute. Get the loot to the subway entrance and get the hell out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_11_02">I&apos;m guessing these terminals contain the Moretta&apos;s comm frequency. Might be worth a look.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_29_03">Some thermite on that vault will weaken the hinges, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_intro_02_03">This one is very important to me. I&apos;m here to make sure you don&apos;t screw it up, yes?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_16_04">Get to the breaker box.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_86_03">We gotta get that keycard, so move into the Oval Office ASAP!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_16_01">Alright, count that up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_05_01">That money needs to be tightly secured by the straps before Locke can take off.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_13_03b">Okay, this baby is gonna need a throne and I know where to get one. See that backyard over there? They have a shitload of stuff stored in the bunker there. So go and bring me a fancy seat.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_32_03">Guys, don&apos;t forget to drill the safe.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_05_05b">Hey! What the fuck!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_139_02">This place is for staff only. Offices can be accessed here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_21_04">Always wanted to come and hit this place.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_29_03">Nice. Now get him to the panic room. Get past that scanner.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_13_02">Drill on the safe, just like we planned. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_57_03">Valentine&apos;s computer should be nearby.</string>

	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_51_any_06">It&apos;s uploading... It&apos;s almost there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_07_02">Too much fire here. We&apos;ll assemble at the silo!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_19_any_02">Sweet! Bring the bag to the van.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_11_any_01">Fucking hell, you threw it in the water!?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_39_03">The van can stay up there, but we still need what&apos;s in it. Plant the C4 on the doors!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_44_03">Please, destroy the radars. Stab their fucking eyes out, so to speak.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_end_03_01">Heisters will be studying your technique for this job for years to come. Great work!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_12_any_09">Nice... Seems to be OK.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_06_01">OK, the database is split into two. I&apos;m getting the first one now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_127_02">Three!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_65_01">We should have brought some gasoline or something to light this up with. But never mind, I&apos;m sure they have something around here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_55_02">Great. We got a full tank, lots of green lights and we&apos;re fat with stolen loot. Hop aboard, my friends. Let&apos;s conclude this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_46_01">Light the fireworks, and stand back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_17_03">The bags go into the cage. The plane gets the cage. We get rich. Easy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_23_02">Ach, that&apos;s what you get from dossing about, friends! They just took the hostage and we gotta go back empty-handed!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_96_01">That looks like the cargo manifest. Good job! It narrows things down. This will make our job easier.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_26_03">Hear that? That&apos;s C4! They&apos;re making entries!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_73_02">Go hit up Crime.net when you are ready.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_15_01">Now, we go! Get on ship!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_106_02">Good job, we already have that code. Use it on the armory.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_31_01">Looks like that box is heavy yeah? There&apos;s a conveyor belt in the main hub area that leads back to the loading dock, through the mountain. Throw it on there and let it do the carrying for you. </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_01_02">Friends! Welcome to Black Ridge. Top secret! What I can tell you is that there is loot here. Very valuable loot. </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_43_01">Police will burst into the house.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_49_07">C&apos;mon friends, get to those lights.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_92_02">One thing after another, yeah? Turn up the ventilation to clear out that gas.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_02_03">Right, you&apos;re going to need the manager&apos;s keycard. Find him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_74_01">OK, now find a way into the mansion.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_81_02">Time to put that drill together. Get those bags.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_30_02">That&apos;s the alarm! The server room&apos;s locked down now - we can&apos;t access it!</string>
	 <string id="btf_cs1_01_02">And if you could sign here, here, here... here, and here. And your initials here. And sign here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_07_03">A saw? Good, that&apos;s gonna come in handy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_35_01">Here I put some bags. You can try out the different weights. Gold is heavy, as you know.  Good to get a feel for them and how far you can throw.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_26_any_03">Good this should help us get the lab door open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_20_03">Take a loot in the Glitter Room, there&apos;s a computer in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_22_any_02">Guys, the place is wired up - stay frosty.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_45_02">Wait... another vault?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_22_02">Use the control panel in the yard to move that firetrap.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_27_01">You&apos;ll need a crowbar to get those elevator doors open!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_12_any_02">Give me the bags!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_56_03">You&apos;ll need to find the evidence storage on the second floor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_63_03">Whoa, looks like some kind of energy weapon. We can use it to blast the door. Just turn it to point the right way, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_69_01">Find that computer.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_intro_03">Ahhh, listen. The coke is being smuggled in goats. Yes, goats. G. O. T&apos;s. And they&apos;ve escaped. Find them all.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_08b_any_06">You know what to do!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_50_02">You need to move to the bio-lab.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_01_03">Hurry! Cops are already on their way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_intro_01_02">We&apos;re here. Time to get your sneak-on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_02_02">Keep going til you see the prison transports.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_01_06">Greetings, friends. The plane is almost above the drop point. Please, get out, kill some Murkies and let&apos;s make that money ours, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_07_any_01">Can&apos;t wait around out here - get into that building as fast as you can. Try the roof.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_08">Bad news, guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_30_01">And another grate. Same as before. Just use the thermal paste.</string>
	 <string id="elp_bigoil_brf_speak_02">An inventor named Rossy - residing somewhere in DC - may have found a cheap way to produce energy from water.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_17_any_01">The alarm locked down the server, now get that last barrier open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_121_01">You&apos;re through to Mortimer at Roberts Bank. I&apos;d be happy to assist.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_25_02">Go recode that key tag.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_33_01">No need to be subtle. Melt that gate!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_38_01">Alex! I&apos;m an idiot for hiring you again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_39_01">Keep the elevator under watch, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_05_03">The guys in the street - take &apos;em out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_end_b_01">No one is going to miss this message. The FBI&apos;s going to search high and low for you but don&apos;t worry... I&apos;ll take care of it. Great work.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_11_04">Yeah, well fuck you too!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_145_01">These are the guest rooms.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_16_01">Come on, stop playing with your little dick cop friends. Find the third pallet, you poes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_21_02">Oh, of course it had to be a Mark II.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_58_01">It stopped! You gotta start it up again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_20_any_03">Let&apos;s do this!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_51_02">Nicely done, now get to the other one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_02_03">Find those prison transports. They should be just up ahead.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_23">I got real bad news!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_06_01">Dallas, come on, you&apos;re standing next to a dumpster.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_23_any_01">Vault&apos;s not open yet... Dammit.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_28_08">Remember to bring Charon&apos;s briefcase!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_23_01">Listen, each path you create will only last a limited time. You can re-create the path - just make sure you aren&apos;t standing on one of the tiles.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_10_01">We got an Inside Man there. They&apos;ll be able to open the gates leading to the vault area. Patching them through now. </string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_01_01">Hey, what the hell is going on? Locke, what are you doing?</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_30_01">Okay... left button!</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_08_03">Not bad, even after all the other shit that&apos;s gone down today.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_27_01">The code is on the screen.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_08_01">Ok, we can still do this. Mr Blonde, you brought the special sauce, right?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_23_01">Ah! Yes, I see it. I&apos;m coming in. Be ready to attach the pallets to the helicopter. And do it quickly, if that is possible. Things are hot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_14_03">Hmm... I don&apos;t know if that really was the server... </string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_45_02">Restart the countdown.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_15_02">You now have access to the West Wing. Get going.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_82_01">Are you looking for tools?</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_36_01">Holy.....nice work! Okay, there&apos;s the exposed vault. Get the cutter on there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_98_02">Out-goddamn-standing, crew! Get in, fill your bags. Take as much as you can, but remember, we&apos;re here for The Dentists&apos; loot.</string>

	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_25_any_01">Here they come!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_64_01">Remember - track down the mobsters. Track them down, and put them down.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_03a">So what kind of shit are we going to find in this place?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_01_01">Now bring the encryption keys back to Hoxton so he can get to work on the next server.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_08_03">You got that key tag?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_05_03">Follow the truck. Come on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_37_01">Don&apos;t forget that nitrogen.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_107_01">The chopper will be leaving! Move!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_16_any_02">Speed up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_10_any_03">Halfway there with the painting collection. Now just get the rest and we&apos;re home free.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_55_02">Done. The doors should be open now friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_170_02">Grab those bags, gang, come on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_62_03">Gang what&apos;s going on? We are not leaving without the briefcase.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_47_03">Go down to the basement door in the back alley!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_02_03">There&apos;s the thugs. Take &apos;em down and get to the elves.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_07_04">I&apos;d appreciate some protection while I work on the door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_01_02">A prison? Not my favourite thing...</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_50_01">Quick! Grab the loot.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_21_02">Was there a radio problem earlier? Need a flare lit, friends, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_17_03">Good, now quietly &apos;persuade&apos; the auctioneer to give you his keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_01_02">Good. Now get those keys back to Hox.</string>

	 <string id="crn_man_01_06">LIKE A GLOVE!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_11_03">Your drill is there. Get it started on that vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_07_any_03">No time to waste - get through that door!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_93_03">Not too good breathing that gas, so clear it out, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_18_01">That rat must be on the other side of that reinforced door. Our inside man left a batch of C4. Grab it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_05_02">Search those boxes. I&apos;m not willing to take any chances on this one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_80_02">O kaek, I wasn&apos;t counting on that. Never can it be easy.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap06_01a">They say a man must spend time in Purgatory before going to hell.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_32_02">Hi! Yes, what can I do for you?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_11_04">There aren&apos;t any monsters behind those doors. I promise, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_64_03">Move that barrel. Quickly now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_57_03">Right, looks like we&apos;re going to need the IT guy. Find him, chop chop!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_49_03">Our Russian friend is somewhere in Shaw, so find a clue for that. Remember, he&apos;s in Shaw.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_12_03">Good job! Throw the coke in the van and get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_91_02">That&apos;s the first number. Keep looking. Two to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_31_01">Vents! Vents! Check the Vents!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_warn_timelimit_van">The van won&apos;t be able to stay long. You gotta move fast when it arrives!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_27">...I&apos;m 65.5% sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_13_02">That reinforced door is heavier than I expected. Must be for the highest level snitches. Alright. Bile&apos;s bringing a lance. Stand by.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_08b_any_02">Hurry up!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_07_01b">Holy shit! Help!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_20_02">Nice. It&apos;s searching the archived emails. Keep the Feds away til it finishes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_62_06">The gunship is back. Keep your heads down, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_34_02">Leave the EMP at the escape area. We don&apos;t wanna risk it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_12_01">Found that evidence storage room yet?</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_08_01b">I have been in the bank one time, a few years ago. The bank manager is an idiot. He keeps his access key in a personal safe, but I don&apos;t remember where.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_59_03">Friends, get that blerrie vehicle out of the way, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_08_05">I think they are all dead. Thanks to you, my friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_15_01">Use the zipline to secure the loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_40_01">They pulled the power!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_05_03">Chopper&apos;s on the scene. Get him there. Just pray he doesn&apos;t reach for the controls.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_20_03">Fuck, this is thorough. Whoever is ratting us out... They&apos;re close.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_15_01">Dozer? Hmmm....</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_12_any_02">OK - looks stable, for now. Add more stuff...</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_17_03">Might want to check out the cafeteria. I can see a PC monitor there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_19_any_01">More cops on the way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_20_03">Finally, the saws are done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_08_02">Use the saw on that door, get the Captain out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_22_02">Move the pieces of the cannon to the pick-up, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_13_03">What? It stopped on the question marks. That could mean anything.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_02_01">OK, cops are inbound. First step, look for C4 in the guard room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_15_01">Boom! Good! Now, inside. Skop, skiet en boomklim!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_end_c_01">You can always rely on the press to swarm on scandal in DC. The weapons deal is the talk of the town. The Elephant and his party are very pleased. Hell of a plan B, folks.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap03_01">Vlad? What brings you to call me?</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_33_03">Make sure Santa is in the tree before it&apos;s airlifted out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_08_03">Look for a way to get the code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_05_02">Get the Jewelry box!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_22_04">There&apos;s just scraps left now! Even if it&apos;s less than I hoped for, it&apos;s still extra money, so go for it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_31_02">The plane needs juice to fly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_47_01">Find that mic recorder, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_10_any_01">Your escape helicopter is here. Try and secure the rest, but if you cant I suggest you get the hell out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_37_02">There&apos;s gotta be something behind these shelves.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_23_01">Put the loot in the Christmas tree!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_end_a_01">Welcome back, crew.  Now we install the cameras in the pictures, trade them to the senator&apos;s guys and get a look on whoever this arms dealer is.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_66_01">That&apos;s the alarm.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_02">Say your prayers and say &apos;em fast!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_01_03">Nice and easy. Time for a casual stroll into the bank, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_30_03">The alarm. All right. Time for Plan B. No mercy, crew.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_04_03">They shot the driver! You&apos;ll have to continue on foot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_23_03">Now burn some rubber!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_30_03">Hurry up guys, answer the phone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_55_03">Now we need those passwords. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_30_any_01">Good job. Four bags is good enough to go and do the trade.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_14_02">Cloakers on the way, sneaky bastards!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_26_01">The Tiffany Room has more than breakfast it seems. A glowing LCD monitor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_18_03">Ok guys, you&apos;re in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_14_01">There&apos;s the briefcase! But you can&apos;t drill that gate. See if you can find some thermite.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_23_01">It will just take a moment, gentlemen. Perhaps use the time to assess your current situation re ammo.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_49_02">You can finish this now, or you can finish this in style, and empty the place.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_18_03">The trace is working but I need more time. Get him back on the line. Keep trashing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_16_02">Damn, that&apos;s a SHIELD! Try and get behind him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_12_any_02">Alright, now throw the bags into the truck. We need at least four bags.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_47_03">There could be more equipment in the drop outside, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_51_01">Guys. Answer that intercom when you&apos;re ready to bail. Whatever you leave behind, stays behind.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_19_03">You got the frequency already. Stay focused!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_51_03">We can try to get him out with an email. Find a compromised computer nearby.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_17_03">Hold it, hold it - wait til everyone&apos;s in the car.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_102_03">Uh, gang, we have a LOT of firepower rolling your way. You need to get to the van right now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_39_any_01">Make sure you keep the power up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_13_any_01">You probably want to hunker down by the warehouse.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_26_04">Commissar gets his hands dirty with some nasty stuff, including kidnapping.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt2_01_02">You think your Uncle Vlad would leave you there and not have support? Shame on you!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_09_03">Now do the other one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_07_02">I&apos;m back in. *whispers* There is no spoon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_48_any_04">All these dead locos, this is messy!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_13_any_01">Public office. Wow, we are in the wrong line of work gentlemen.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_12_any_01">Alright, looks like we have... 11... 12 prototypes. See if you can find something around the house that can indicate which is the working one. Then pick it up and get it to me.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_29_03">Garrett could come back any time, so don&apos;t lose track of him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_70_02">Find a centrifuge.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_07_02">Sweet sweet cash! Now bag it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_50_02">Gate won&apos;t open with you standing on it, genius. Clear the area!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_12_any_01">That&apos;s 40 thousand, only ten more to go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_56_03">Friends, Murkywater operatives are in the area. How did they find us? </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_19_02">This is trouble... I see at least nine guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_14_any_01">Good, with that guy out of the picture, no more cameras.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_11_02">Hmm. Looks like one of the boxes we came for is in the archive. No way to get in there on foot, but there&apos;s a crane you can use in the central hub area, but you gotta find the right shelf.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_15_01">Gang, remember: boost the gold out to container 61.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_03_02">OK  friends, get into the vault room by cutting open that teller door with a saw.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_38_01">OK, there&apos;s a clear entrance behind the shrine but we&apos;ll need to blow it open. </string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_12_any_02">This is definitely going to make our lives easier when we go in to hit the Democrat&apos;s place.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_56b_any_03">... I&apos;m coming back soon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_21_02">Oh no, they sent an attack helicopter!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_31_01">Look for the armory. Intel says they&apos;re holding C4. For &quot;extraordinary cases&quot;. Well, this is one of those extraordinary cases.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_36_01">Slow vaults down there, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_24_01">You gotta get the security bars open. Crack open the card reader near it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_15_01">Check the trucks for ingredients we can use.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_03_01">Boris, my driver, will come and pick you guys up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_12_any_02">40 thousand dollars destroyed so far.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_88_01">Let Bile know you&apos;re ready by lighting a flare, yeah!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_41_03">Power is back! Get back to scanning the test-subjects.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_33_03">Some nice stuff in those cases. Some knock-offs too. If you&apos;re going to snatch it, snatch the real stuff - look for cases with alarms. I&apos;m sure a clever crew like you can figure it out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_40_any_02">He delivered the engine. I&apos;ll have my man here inspect it, and if it&apos;s the right one we&apos;re good to go. So hang tight for a sec.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_79_03">This district matches with... Hmmm, give me some more time...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_15">...these internet descriptions are iffy at best.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_08_01">102!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_25_02">That crate is sealed tight. Maybe there&apos;s something you can use nearby to crack it open, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_42_01">Ah! Those fucking shit-eating poes are stealing my money. Our money...sorry. Stop them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_37_01">Now pick up the drill and the thermite, it&apos;s hidden inside the copy machine!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_02d">Seriously though, if they got them ray guns, they&apos;re coming with me.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_03a">Can&apos;t believe we&apos;re going back to this place. </string>
	 <string id="plc_cs1_05_01">Son, I&apos;m giving you three minutes to get them to this phone, or I&apos;m booking you for wasting police time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_19_01">Guys, get into those cars and find the one with the turret.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_67_02">Dwankie kerels turned off the power. You gotta get it going again!</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_14_03">Eh, It belonged to old relatives, family heirlooms, you know?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_62_01">Ah, it&apos;s empty! Find another one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_101_02">That&apos;s The Dentists&apos; loot saved. Bail now, or really show The Grin how we treat Vegas DC-style.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_61_any_05">Ten more secs!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_05_01">Damn it! Looks like we need local access. Most likely one of the staff terminals. Figure out which one. Try &apos;em all, if you have to.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_09_02">A great haul, gang. Another top job.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_41_01">Alright, the parking lot behind the bank is where the pilot is expecting to pick up the cage. Have it ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_15_02">The wheel stopped on... dozer? Be careful guys Im not sure what that means.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_03">Brace for impact!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_05_02">Excellent. The increased drag will slow the plane and force the pilot to fly lower. As expected. Now, get to the cargo controls. You see them above you? So close, yet so far. The only way to get up there is by the stairs at the front of the plane.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_19_01">Don&apos;t forget the goat in the scaffold.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_52_03">Nice and quiet! Good job friends!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_03_08">Take care of the snipers, please!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_14_06">Keep looking and you&apos;ll find it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_32_02">Nice, seems the power is back. </string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_08_any_01">Looks like some intel. That&apos;ll come in handy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_11_03">Check in the employee lunchroom. There&apos;s a router there that&apos;ll let me unlock the door for you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_78_02">OK, now we gotta cut into those boxes the old fashioned way- with a hacking device!</string>
	 <string id="csm_cs1_01_02">Hey, I&apos;m having trouble with my account on the computer. Do I internet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_03_05">You gotta take a look at the security situation, guys.</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_04_02">You get coke into the helicopter, I make you rich. You don&apos;t, you make me sad. A sad Vlad... Is bad.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_01_02">There it is, right ahead. Do your thing, guys, but do it quietly. It goes loud, and I&apos;ll have to pull you out fast.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_34_01">Guys, you still need to secure the EMP at the escape area.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_30_01">That crowbar will increase our chances of getting additional loot before we leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_19">I had a feeling that was the wrong stuff...</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_15_any_02">The escape van just left. I&apos;ll get him to come round for another pass but be ready this time.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_intro_02_03">Well, if you want your mechandise back you will not interfere with the operation. Old Locke doesn&apos;t need any backseat drivers!</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_23_01">I&apos;ll keep schtum in here til you&apos;re back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_07_01">101!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_05_02">Got an old maat in the FBI who owed me a favor to fix up a laptop for us. Said she would mark it&apos;s location on a whiteboard somewhere, so go find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_80_02">There&apos;s the ladder, guys. Get up there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_04_any_03">People, I got the pick-up driver right here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_60_02">Blerrie, move the van already!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_10_03">There goes the wall. Now go on in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_55_02">The alarm! Stealth is out of the window, gang. But the ship is moving, and she ain&apos;t gonna stop now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_22_01">Nice. That&apos;s the first batch, but we&apos;ll need more. Get after the rest.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_10_any_03">Alarm boxes identified. Go and disrupt them for me.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_60_04">What are you waiting for? Pick up the box!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_intro_a_02">OK, the chopper&apos;s coming over the convoy now, we&apos;re on a bridge - well done Alex... For once...  Hit &apos;em and finish it. The money&apos;s ours no matter what. Get it done.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_135_02">A beautiful sight, yeah? Never thought I&apos;d be that pleased to see a bunch of papers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_12_03">Cops are on their way. Looks like they had a lot of guys in the neighborhood.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb2_02_01">You guys all finished? Get down here. Got us a sweet ride!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_44_02">The bus is all set up to... Well, you worry about sending the signal. Then you&apos;ll see.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_11_any_01">35 thousand dollars.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_31_02">We almost had it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_end_01">Well done, friends. We pulled the rug from right under Commissioner Garrett and I expect his next few hours won&apos;t be very pleasant. Oh, to be there when he goes to his meeting empty-handed, yeah? Bain would be proud. As soon as you get back to the safehouse, Duke should get cracking on examining the Elephant&apos;s box. We&apos;ve got to know how it connects to the one you acquired in Las Vegas, to Bain&apos;s grail-dinges and these Kataru chops. Then we plan our next move.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_09">...that&apos;s my very best guess.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_69_01">The cannon is ready, hit that nice shiny button and let&apos;s see what it can do!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_22_02">The Murky resources we&apos;re after will be weapons. They could be anywhere so you&apos;ll just have to start looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_09_03">Manager&apos;s got a black suit, thinning hair. Find him, tie him - that might make him more helpful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_09_03">Nice. Now get that evidence to the lab. Any DNA might help us finger this rat.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cs1_02_01">Uhhh, negative, Broadsword. Roof approach is not good. Over.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_intro_a_01">Get out! Get the bags before the FBI catches up to us again. I know, they&apos;re persistent little bastards, aren&apos;t they?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_99_03">More laser defences. Forget disabling them. Just watch the pattern and be ready to run through. </string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_18_any_02">Guys they are fucking up more intel!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_14_02">Damn! Someone must have found the body! Take him out before he sounds the alarm!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_20_03">The EMP is charging again.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_15_01b">I am so glad to hear that!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_56_02">You gotta blow that door. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_e_07">Go for it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_18_any_01">It has to be in there somewhere. Check the safes in the back first.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_58_09">You fellas hit harder than my first wife.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_24_03">Dear hearts! You see me? Yes, I am here. For sure. I hate to be a bother, but would you mind strapping that lovely money to my helicopter?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_18_03">You can secure loot through that open window there. Got a guy I trust ready to collect, but only if things are quiet.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_08_02">Go inside and see if there&apos;s a clue to the code anywhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_102_03">That&apos;s the guard dealt with. No need to worry about the cameras now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_snipers_deployed_01">A police chopper is coming in to drop of sniper on a nearby building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_15_01">Damn! The cops have blocked the tracks up ahead, which means you need to be gone before you reach that point. Get the BCI tech and run back to the chopper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_49_01">Briefcase with high-temperature thermite paste will be waiting for you here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_17_02">Capping that dwankie would feel right good, but we need him alive, so hands off the triggers, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_118_03">Goddammit, a laser gate. We&apos;ve dealt with these before. Just wait for it to flicker off, and then dash through.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_19_01">First thing to do is find that plane.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_intro_02">You guys ready to become legends?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_17_03">That&apos;s another one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_41_03">All right, nice work! Now get to the container. Drop the gas can there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_03_01">That&apos;s the server room. Get inside and get me connected.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_35_02">The Beast is at work. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_28_03">Almost got it. Faster, faster, faster.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_42_03">Turn on the water again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_09_03">Don&apos;t just stand around! Get the gate open and secure the BCI tech.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_cash_cnc_02">We got a cash situation in this bank. They have missed their delivery to the HQ this week. Don&apos;t everyone sigh all at once...</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_26_any_01">Now there&apos;s only one more door between you and the server.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_05_01">Now use the keycard to get inside the server room. It&apos;s on the second floor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_11_02">The saw stopped, restart it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_03_02">Okay, trucks are somewhere on this freeway.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_intro_a_01b">Once you&apos;re in find the manager&apos;s office, find his safe, and clean it out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_59_02">God damn it! They locked the containers! Must&apos;ve been the alarms. Alright, we break through.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_49_01">Bag those gems.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_112_01">This is the Storage Room. Check for a keycard. Might be a radio here too.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_42_03">What happened? Do you read me friends?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_38_02">OK, that probably does something interesting. Try it.</string>
	 <string id="crn_man_01_07">Like... a glooove...</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_70_03">This is not a good day for Murkywater or the Dentist, yeah?! For sure!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_intro_05">I&apos;m a bit worried our intel on the Murkys is bad.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_112_01">That laptop had one part of the vault code. There are two more around there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_03_08">Just gotta keep looking until you find the laptop.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_15_02">Look for Twitch in the alley!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_08_01">Shoot at the wires to make em snap!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_14_02">Time to go! Come on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_24">He was always on the vuvuzela, so my thanks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_11_02">Good job. Answer the pager and then hide the body in the dumpster.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_38_any_02">Six left!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_25_03">This tree will fly in the sky. Light a flare on the roof, and Bile will bring in some C4 for you so you can blow the roof open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_51_02">There goes the time lock. You&apos;re doing great. Try and keep things quiet. Now, the vault has three steps to open it. First is in the bag - just go there and use the fingerprint scanner.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_46_03">From the crust of the Earth to our bank accounts. Gorgeous.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_40_03">That&apos;s the head of security. Hmm... he&apos;s in the garden I think.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_29_03">Dammit, SWATS have hit the ground floor, coming from the left staircase.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_07_03">There he is. Locke.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_21_06">Look for the cell block!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_12_02">You did it! Now, throw the cocaine in the back and let&apos;s head out.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_02_01">We need to find the Operations Room. That&apos;s where we&apos;ll find the info we need.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_intro_a_01">The FBI temp office is across the street. Sneak inside, get me access to their server room and see what other Mendoza info is lying around.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_11">I can&apos;t shake &apos;em!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_03_01">That&apos;s both of the keycards. Alright, get to the vault and get them to work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_03_01">This startled the whole town! The cops are locking everything down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_intro_01_01">Alright! We stopped the convoy, now get it open and secure the loot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_19_01">Just got a message from The Elephant. Your bonus for keeping things clandestine has been dropped off. It&apos;s near the escape van.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_17_03">Hurry now, you gotta follow Bain!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_33_03">If I can find it, I can show you remotely which workstation you need to access to fix this.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap01_03">Hope you like being on TV. Buluc records sound and picture in every room in the house. Fucking crazy!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_59_03">If the van is blocking, move it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_56_02">Great. We&apos;re connected.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_09_03">Hang on... oh... they&apos;ve got additional security blocks here. You gotta find a security switchboard and rewire it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_15_01">Go out to the van and pick up the C4. Plant it on the street.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_pkp_01_01">The pick-up truck is gonna be here in a few seconds.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_23_any_07">Eleven bags!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_25_03">Huh. Haven&apos;t seen one like that before. Maybe there&apos;s a manual in one of the utility closets.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_27_01">Sending you the lance in the elevator. Get ready for it, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_08_01">You just triggered the countdown! Find and disable the alarm before it&apos;s timer runs out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_61_04">Have you taken care of the food yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_26_07">Well, this dump is the perfect place for a rat like the Commissar to hide out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_24_02">Still need to disable those security boxes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_29_01">If you&apos;re done, it&apos;s time to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_par_01_01">Woah, jackpot! We hit &apos;em good! That truck is out of action. Get to work!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_50_01">Typical, I&apos;m being locked out of the network. Must be a firewall. See if you can bypass it from another terminal.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_03_04">Get your thumbs out of your asses and come get me!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_48_03">You need to get to hacking. Find the server room!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_70_01">What the hell was that? Did they just blow up another entrance?</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_43_03">It might be worth to check the maintenance tunnels.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_67_02">See that guitar case over there? That&apos;s your gear.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_14_any_03">Clock&apos;s ticking - just move it along, we don&apos;t have all day.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_14_02">Did you find what we&apos;re looking for?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_23_01">Bain is heading for the roof, try to keep up with him, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_44_02">Would you look at that!? We did it, gang. We did it.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_01_03">About three minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_68_02">It&apos;s all quiet still. Fantastic. Now open the gate.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_120_02">The hack is almost through...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_23_02">Good work, now watch &apos;em overheat. You&apos;ll get that system reboot.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_06_03b">Hello? Don&apos;t go without me!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_deposit_cnc_07">Happy birthday. Vault full of freshly loaded safe deposit boxes. Who&apos;s in?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_67_03">You&apos;re keeping it quiet. Great. Remember - you need keycards.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_17_02">Woah, we just lost of whole bucket of lights. Fix the hardware up there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_37_01">I love this room. Give your weapons a try in here. </string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_32_01">The winch will be there in one minute, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_20_01">Ok, good. The charging has been restarted.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_60_01">One of you guys answer the phone and patch me through.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_21_any_01">So this means you have to find it. References seem to indicate it&apos;s... Connected to a bookshelf. I know, leave it to a politician to be cliche.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_40_01">You found it! Time to bring some trees down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_05_01">Okay, you&apos;re good to go. Start the hack.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_28_03">Look for the lead scientist and get him to the security door. </string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_18_03">Be on the lookout if one the saws jam or something. We need to get this done quick.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_156_01">Great! That&apos;s the door open! Only thing left is disabling the lasers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_intro_06_01">Our driver has pulled the ambulance over and ran for it. And here comes the target, right on schedule...</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_07_05b">Not like this, not like this!</string>
	 <string id="crn_man_01_04">Like... a glove.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_19_03">Alright. The code. Well, my first thought is that it is probably on someone&apos;s email. Find a terminal and get in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_42_01">Good. Now keep the cops off of it.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_03_02">Ok guys. Busting cars I hear. Attach the magnet - this one&apos;s going for a swim!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_09_any_01">That&apos;s the last one for Hector, well done. Up to you boys if you want to get more or pull out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_46_02">Now swipe the card on the panel in the other control room. Get that gate open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_06_any_01">Better get moving boys, the longer it takes the more cops are going to show up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_18_02">Why isn&apos;t that chopper on any flight plans?</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_02_02">Oh, yeah, right, sure. Alright, well, have him check in when he can.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_21_02">Hook me into the reception computer so that I can see where the doctors are keeping our target.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_16_03">And boom! They&apos;re not using that skywalk.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_06_02">Ok now, which transport is he in? Saw them all open and find out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_68_02">Damn cops are trying to cut power to the router boxes! Stop them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_52_01">You&apos;re close to the FBI boss. Keep your finger off the trigger, we may need him alive.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_21a_01">Yeah get these fucking chains off man!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_36_01">They might be onto us, so don&apos;t take too long.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_18_02">Find those fucking bundles, will you? Analysis of trajectory indicates...they must be fucking close!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_117_01">Friends, hook me up to the mainframe, hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_48_any_01">OK, he&apos;s refueling now. I&apos;ve told him to hurry but...</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_03_01">Your instincts are correct my friend. You&apos;ll have to take him out.</string>
	 <string id="bru_run_01_03">Almost there, guys!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_14_01">Is the pickup coming? This is getting pretty hot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_20_02">We came, we saw, we kicked their ass!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_07b_any_04">... you should see me coming any second!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_28_02">That vault is a thing of beauty, yeah? </string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_03_03">Get cracking. Penetrate the fort.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_95_03">The weapon will not fire until you replace the empty power cells.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_13_any_01">SWAT! I knew it was too easy!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_93_02">The chopper is ready to leave!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_86_03">The key is not going to work any longer, you gotta use a drill, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_33_02">We got regular cops and SWATS on the scene.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_17_02">That&apos;s the last closet. Get it open. Keep it quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_79_01">Get away from the gate! Fast!</string>
	 <string id="alm_bex_01_02">Which way does this GPS go? Is Texas north or south? I think I&apos;m on the right street.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_54_01">Time to get you out of there. Grab whatever loot you can on the way out.</string>
	 <string id="plt_flt_02_03">Hey! I&apos;m getting peppered over here! As long as the snipers are breathing, I can&apos;t get close enough to make the drop!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_111_02">Light that flare, gang. Bile needs to drop off the winch.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_04_03">Someone tried to take a goat. Make special pet, yeah? Like Igor the Serb and his &quot;special&quot; pets. &quot;Special&quot;. Get into that apartment and rescue it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_33_03">That winch has stopped working. See if you can fix it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_37_01">Look for numbers in connection with Crimenet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_30_01">Good job, now we need some more on the fourth floor and the roof.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_06_03">The wheel has decided, looks like we have some more snipers incoming.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_31_02">Achhh! The paw-paw courier forgot the winch! I&apos;ll have to get one to you by train. Keep looking up, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_05_any_01">Great, you found the laptop.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_03_06">What the hell are you two all dressed up for, is it halloween?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_65_02">See if you can find some batteries to power it, then set them up, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_01">Ah! That fucker owed me $20. Ah well.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_10_02">Hose has been disconnected. </string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_05_01">Nicely done. Now we gotta find out where Bain is being held. Make your way to the cell block.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_38_02">That&apos;s the cutter done. Let the money rain down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_49_01">Guys, Fedor is waiting over at the lake. It&apos;s time to leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_35_any_02">Pop the flare so we can bring the chopper in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_78_01">Haha! That should rustle Garrett&apos;s nerves a bit for when he goes to meet the Kataru empty-handed. Now secure the box and get out of there. </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_10_01">Gotta move fast, friends. Murky are going to come down on you hard soon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_18_01">Ok, you&apos;ll have to open that safe now!</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cs1_05_01">About another three minutes. Over.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_02_03">Find Sosa&apos;s head of security - he&apos;ll have a USB stick with security codes. He&apos;s a man of habit - always wears a green jacket.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_39_01b">I know that crest! it belonged to the Romanov dynasty, for sure!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_45_01">Capitol Hill Candy!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_08a_any_01">I&apos;m here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_108_03">No, something is wrong... now you gotta wait until the reaction dies down and start again, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="mch_pal_intro_01">Hey, it&apos;s Mitchell, over at Keel Street. The pipes, you know? The ones you &quot;fixed&quot;? Yeah, they&apos;re leaking again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_05_any_01">That seems to be a keycard, we can probably use that later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_08_any_01">The bus blew up! Be careful and stay out of that fire!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_57_03">Damn, BFD  lost power. Damn cops... reconnect the sockets.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_brf_c_01">I couldn&apos;t locate the right truck through the shipping data you uploaded, so we won&apos;t be able to intercept those voting machines. However, we can still keep the Elephant sweet. There&apos;s a bank next to the polling place. We&apos;re going to hit it. Except we&apos;re not, not really, &apos;cos you&apos;re real goal is hitting the server with the polling results next door. Hit the bank, open the vault, all that stuff, but remember that the real objective is fucking up that polling place.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_16_any_01">They just blew a hole in the wall! Hold them back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_67_01">What are you guys doing down there? Look for the light.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_28_02">It&apos;s a beautiful building. Serene. Try and keep it that way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_57_02">Got the code. Get back to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_49_01">Turn off Garrett&apos;s lights, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_33_02">That&apos;s the alarm. No more tip-toeing, gang. It&apos;s all about speed and violence now. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_07_02">Right panel&apos;s activated. Now get the other keycard, and let&apos;s get the second panel done.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_55_05">You need to get inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_05_01">Now enter the password.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_59_03">Brown&apos;s computer should be nearby.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_85_01">Two bags. It&apos;s all gravy from here. Don&apos;t stop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_24_any_01">Add hydrogen chloride to continue the process!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_54_02">Crew! Don&apos;t lose focus. We&apos;re here for cash, and it&apos;s there for you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_68_03">They put sprinklers on! The fire went out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_46_01">Right. He got called in to a meeting with a big account. He&apos;s doing a great job.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_32_03">Garrett is old school... sticks to what he knows. Things like history.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_33_04">Look for something to do with history.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_08_02">You got the whole database. Great work. Absolute badasses!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_01_02">Two ways to go about this, gentlemen. Go loud - you know how to do that. But if you&apos;re hoping to raise your game, look for two keycards and unlock the vault. Car trunks are a good place to look.</string>
	 <string id="csk_cs1_01_02">Can you page Miss Pizakuick? First name Ayneeda?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_32_01">That&apos;s one. Remember the number AND the color.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_27_02">Keep those Murkys away from us!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_28_01">You&apos;re going to need two key cards to get in there. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_30_02">Looks like the Feds got a better budget this year. That&apos;s a new model K, no way to get in quietly without the code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_07_any_02">Guys, three bags should be enough to do the trade.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_90_02">The codex will help tell you the proper symbols and in which order they need entering.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_18_02">Damn, he hung up. Somewhere in the city. Keep breaking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_11_any_01">Damn it! They&apos;ve spotted you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_cnc_01">Ok gang, looks like we&apos;re going after some diamonds.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_12_04">You&apos;ve got to find the evidence storage!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_45_01">Friends, get the chain from the truck and attach it to the teller window!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_21_01">Something there. Right outside the Glitter Room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_08_03">Find those valves. We need the sprinklers working.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_54b_any_04">... now you&apos;re just showing off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_50_01">You have to get off the gate before it will open. Health and safety bullshit!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_37_01">Hold on guys, I&apos;ll send some C4...</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_27_02">Look at the crowd. Insane. Right, focus on the job, and let&apos;s give them a show.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_04_02b">Fuck, fuck, fuck! There&apos;s more of &apos;em!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_55_01">It&apos;s a good thing you took all the money before the explosion.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_48_03">Domkops! Get indoors!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_17_any_05">This is going to be a profitable run.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_17_03">Gang, you need to protect the EMP while it charges! Prepare to fight!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_66_02">Kerels got to the IT guy, get in there and stop them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_47_02">Get down to the basement guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_50_02">Nicely done, friends. That&apos;s what we&apos;re looking for.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_10_02">Fire&apos;s out. And people think all we do is cause chaos!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_79_02">There&apos;s got to be something here that can breach the cell block door!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_42_02">Those doors. You gotta get them open for sure, because the vault&apos;s behind them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_19_01">Now use the print to open the safe and get the key.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_08_04">We need muriatic acid!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_19_02">What&apos;s wrong with you? You have the frequencies!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_15_01">He&apos;s here, throw in the stuff!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_42_02">You&apos;ve seen that model before. Hard to break.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_22_03">There&apos;s not much left now... If you just hurry up you might make a few extra grand.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_05_01">Great. Now crack those trucks open. Let&apos;s see what Vlad was shipping.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_13_01">That was an empty cell. Try again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_05_02">Great. There&apos;s no shortage of buyers for these military rounds.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_09_any_01">The van is right across the street.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_56_03">All right. More C4. Almost got all we need now. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_29_02">You got everything. Time to go home.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_53_04">Looks like stealth is off, get ready for a fight.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_07_any_07">OK! We got some real scandal stuff here. He sold government arms to a rogue state - got paid in gold. The Democrats aint gonna like this.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_23_02">...you&apos;ll find it in a trash container by the parking lot, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_29_02">Ok guys, time to get out. Leave the tower and move along the bridge.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_23_01">Move the gold onto the truck! The crane can do it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_74_03">You&apos;ll need something special for that door. Go check the armory!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_127_02">That&apos;s one taken care of. Time to do the next.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_16_03">Keep your head down and avoid the cameras.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_kb8_01">You&apos;ve got to keep at least 8 bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_17_02">Time to use the keycard you picked up. Have your gun ready and take out anyone on the other side of that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_45_01">Excellent work, gang! Absolutely amazing. But now you need to get out of there before the place collapses.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_16_02">Gang, the EMP needs to charge up before we can use it. It will take some time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_01_01">Get him!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_07_03">I think you&apos;re going to find the vault on the other side of those doors.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_97_01">Find the manhole out in the parking lot. You&apos;re going subterranean.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_16_02">The wheel stopped. Get ready for another bulldozer guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_79_03">I found something for you to use.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_15_01b">Fuck, this is gonna be tricky... Yeah, you can&apos;t do it yourselves. Take me to the garage where I can take a bike apart to collect some special shit for this babe.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_39a_01">Part of Vlad thinks it would be fun just to burn the whole place down, but with my luck, this asshole would just get away.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_43_01a">Oh blerrie hell. We don&apos;t have time for this. Fine, take his crappy car then.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_03_13">If we have time, I&apos;m going to... appreciate... some of the artwork in there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_78_01">Ok, hold on for a while.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_49_04">Make the Commissioner&apos;s mood darker than it already is. Ha, Locke is no joker, eh?</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_23_02">You need to use the thermite to get past that security gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_20_any_01">Get to the chopper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_14_02">We&apos;ve breached the fortress! Get inside!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_27_04">Restart the drill, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_38_02">I can&apos;t believe I hired you again, Alex...</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_08_03">That&apos;s it. Ahhhhh, almost tempted. To see two suns in the sunset.  (sighs) Zavorazhivayushiy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_03_03">Watch out friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_17_02">They weren&apos;t expecting that! Now, time to find that Russian rat.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_04">I&apos;m losing control!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_17_01">Now subdue the auctioneer so you can get his keycard.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_11">Don&apos;t run away again, little goat.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_07_02">The mechanic said he needed a gas tank and exhaust pipes from the workshop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_44_01">Hear that noise? Some C4 just dropped through the roof. Go pick it up and stick it to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_01_02">This area is usually full of spoiled, rich movie stars buying useless junk.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_118_02">There, friends. I&apos;ve got access but it will take a bit of time for me to get through.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_13_any_02">Almost there guys, forty-five thousand.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_53_03">You gotta restart the hack!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_35_03">This is going rather well so far, if old Locke says so himself!</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_03_11">What&apos;re you now, fuckin&apos; Milton?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_02_01">Now keep moving. And as much as you hate this, this is still a real thing. You get discovered you&apos;ll trigger the alarm.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_24_03">Blueprints show a power box on the upper floor. Get to it and cut the power.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_16_02">Ok, he&apos;s off... now follow him through the laundry room!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_54_02">Good friends, now just add one more ingredient, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_96_03">You just gotta turn everything upside-down, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_intro_a_01">I don&apos;t know how the bikers know we&apos;re coming but they do. Maybe all that meth they&apos;re doing gives them a sixth sense...</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_08_01a">I have been in the bank one time, a few years ago. The bank manager is an idiot. He keeps his access key in a personal safe, but I don&apos;t actually remember where.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_06_02">Go, guys. Dont lose the scent!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_62_02">That won&apos;t do, everything is encrypted. We need more codes!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_65_01">Now keep the kerels away while he does his job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_39_03">Just wait and see guys, this is gonna be great.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_88_02">Get those chains off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_21_03">Guys, find something we can use on those bars. Something that doesn&apos;t give off too much noise.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_08_any_01">OK, you found it. Now, open up that safe.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap07_05">If guests get in the way, shoot them too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_44_02">A keycard, but no damn good right now. Alarm&apos;s been sounded. Stay focused on the task.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_39_01">You&apos;ll need some kind of explosive accelerant. Mulching fertilizer, diesel fuel... maybe these people even have some C4 laying around. See what you can dig up. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_13_01">Oh man, the pilot just went down again. Wake that old wino up!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_59_any_04">One more minute, then I got to scram!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_06_02">Too many bullets flyin&apos; here! Get the hostage to the room in the back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_17">Shit. Just... shit.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_04_01">They got Eddie! You&apos;ll have to continue on foot.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_64_01">First thing to do is find that plane. Start by looking in the hangars. </string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_30_02">Excellent, gang. Now, just plant some more on the fourth floor and the roof.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_28_03">They&apos;re blowing the doors off the railcars. You&apos;re going to be exposed to sniper fire in there, so be careful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_107_03">Keycard. Great. You need to use it on the vault, but that&apos;s only half of it. Swipe it, and then hunt down the second card.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_01_03">Docks are right there. Head in. And watch for guards. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_48_07">The black cat ate its own balls.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_03_03">Go find the bank manager. We&apos;ll need that keycard off him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_41_03">Time to make some explosives! Get all the items together so you can arm the device.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_00_01">OK, friends not much time until the coppers get there. Go have a look inside the bank.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_11_03">I can&apos;t take the snipers out! Help me, yes?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_25">...I&apos;m 72% sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_09_02">There&apos;s the C4, gang. Someone grab it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_05_01">You gotta help Charon! Clear the street!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_41_03">The plane has the parking lot locked in for the pick-up. Get that area ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_52_01">Get some fake sentry guns up and running. It&apos;ll buy us some time and keep people in place.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_25_any_01">Confirmed! I&apos;m coming in at dock seven!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_42_01">Come on guys, arm the explosives!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_cbf_01_01">The Teuer dealership is one of the few East Coast showrooms that sells Falcogini cars. They just got the hot new model in - the La Troienne. I got some people overseas who are willing to pay big for this little beauty. Get in there, get to the wheels and get them out. Simple, right?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_45_any_01">Alright, we got spotted by the cameras. We got to go to plan B.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_02_01">That&apos;s one of the keycards for the vault, but you need another. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_kb6_01">You&apos;ve got to keep at least 6 bags!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_44_03">The artifact... it&apos;s why we&apos;re here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_37_03">Sending the van your way. Twitch will come from the upper bridge side.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_10_02">It&apos;s a quiet neighborhood. You&apos;ll be fine. I&apos;ll be right back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_11_01">We need to lower those bollards. Find the control room. Gotta be one of these doors. </string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_03_11">I don&apos;t think this trash can has been emptied since Bush was in power. Bush senior!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_12_any_01">Come on come on, we can do better!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_53_02">Sure there must be loot all over this place. Search the rooms if you fancy a few extra Benjamins.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_61_01">Ah! Yes. The vault is opening again! Good!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_brief_02b">We don&apos;t want them stopping us from getting the intel before we get it. Find the safe, it&apos;s probably there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_03_01">Remember, check the Murkywater shipping containers for the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_intro_a_01">Remember. Go in, get the tiara, hit the store for more jewels if you feel lucky - the place is loaded. But watch out for guards, cameras, metal detectors. </string>
	 <string id="loc_run_05_01">Follow Bile! Remember to bring the prisoner with you! And keep him alive!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_32_03">You&apos;ll have your winch in about a minute, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_28_07">Don&apos;t forget Charon&apos;s briefcase!</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_01_01">One minute. Hey, move your ass.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_51_02">Okay, blimp is lowering her to you. BFD. Look at that beauty.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_59_01">The kerels have stopped the drill!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_91_01">Guys! The van!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_49_03">Keep the coppers away from the servers, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_03_05">Sorry, is the floor wet? You piss in your panties, little baby?</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_14_02">How about that escape? Is your driver coming?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_93_02">See if you can find some fertilizer in the cellar. Would be a good place for them to keep it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_14_any_01">Be careful! They have snipers incoming!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_76_01">Great! He should be back gambling in no time. Wait for him to take a sip, let nature do its thing. When he dashes off to the crapper, follow him and get that card.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_38_02">...The hook needs to go on the vault, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_20_any_02">Was hoping we&apos;d do this without police for once.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_05_05">I guess a neighbour saw something. We got cops on the way to check things out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_52_03">It&apos;s trying to auto-update! Stop it, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_82_02">...Remember to take the boxes from the conveyor on the loading dock, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_47_02">That damn barrier is preventing the drill from coming down. Get to security and open it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_81_05">Any loot you want to take back needs to be secured.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_09_01">The drill is in the copy machine here, but hopefully we won&apos;t need it. Just remember, though...if we should.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_73_01">We need Ralph Garnet&apos;s keycard. Find him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_02_any_03">That entrance looks tough. Can you get around it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_27_01">Opening the vault needs a three digit code. Each digit is held by a manager, and each is in a computer briefcase. We need that code. Find them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_34_03">Hold on until he&apos;s in the tree!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_46_any_03">You can&apos;t let them kill the power, it&apos;ll slow everything down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_12_01">The gold is inside the safe. No time to waste now. Set up the drill and drill it open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_06_02">Two minutes until the customer is on the scene. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_90_01">Get to the van!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_09_02">Ok, so maybe blending in isn&apos;t our style. Sending the helicopter now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_03_03">Locke is gone, that backstabber, but we&apos;ll get him for this later. Mark my words.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_26_02">He&apos;s heavier than I thought! Now, let&apos;s go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_07_03">Good, now locate that laptop and get hacking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_13_01">Cops are closing in on the arena. Stay on your toes, this will get hairy.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_39_07">Not the tree! Stop shooting at it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_60_01">Move the van, you chops!</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_20_01a">Guys, you better tell my brother-in-law to step on it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_35_01">They are cutting off the road! Shit, not sure if the plane is gonna be able to land.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_167_02">And how much will it cost you? Shall we say... 18 bucks?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_38_01">Hey! Gang, we can&apos;t lift the container while you&apos;re inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_17_01">The chopper is coming at the antenna!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_09_03">I can&apos;t wait to see what these shady assholes were hiding on that server.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_05_03">Vault&apos;s opening. Get in there! Bag that cash! </string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_28_03">Excellent. Just the fifth floor and the roof left. Get going, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_01_any_01">OK guys, get inside and locate the art. We want the paintings with the red stickers on. Look out for guards and cameras.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_16_01">Another door. Watch the guards and cameras, gang...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_89_02">When you want Bile to land, set up a flare!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_04_06">I&apos;ll feed you to my rottweilers. Dog food, is what you are.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_88_03">The code begins with a seven, according to my source.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_65_02">You&apos;re going to have DC&apos;s finest crawling up your ass. Cops on the scene.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_60_02">Get the keycard from the auctioneer.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_139_03">Get out there and take the AA guns offline!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_12_02">The gold is inside the safe. Drill it open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_73_02">That&apos;s a sweet pile of counterfeit cash. Beautiful. Grab it. And if you fancy a little more...</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_76_03">Set out a smoke signal for the pilot to zero in on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_70_02">Head back to the skylight where you came in and bring the box.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_46_02">You got spotted! Keep your eyes open for kerels!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_a_03">Okay, what&apos;s next...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_03_03">Sorry, friends. Looks like we didn&apos;t get you in clean. The place is on alert and locked down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_21_02">All right, bridge is turning back. Gonna take a few minutes though. Hold off the cops, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_19_01">I&apos;m almost there, gang. He&apos;s gotta be close to the centre. Could be... Damn, still too vague. Keep going. </string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_17_any_02">It&apos;s open... No cash... Hit the deposit boxes...</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_73_01">OK, first you gotta get to the Oval Office in the West Wing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_10_03">Now go deal with obstruction to the yard over there. You&apos;re getting out that way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_32_02">Hit the roof, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_05_03">Alright, I have an idea. I want you to hack into anything you can find connected down there. If I can get access to their databases, I might be able to find where our truck is headed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_46_02">The area isn&apos;t too big. You should be able to move around and search all corners of the whole train yard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_22_any_01">Damn it! Plan B, just find that server room!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_34_any_01">Keep it under control.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_30secs_to_departure_heli">You have 30 seconds to get your ass on that chopper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_09_01">Dammit, the cops disabled the hacking device! You need to reboot it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_94_03">There you go! Now get those gems!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_55_01">Two minutes, guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_09_07">Should have been soda.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_50_02">Get going friends, the place is going to be crawling with kerels soon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_24_02">That&apos;s all the C4 we need.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_96_02">Found any new power cells?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_01_01">Your first job is getting into the depot. Scout the area, check for cameras and guards. Keep it quiet.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_22_03">Just raise the balloon when you&apos;re done, groovers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_47_03">Start carrying all the loot out to the car so Mr. Blonde can get away with it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_87_03">Ah, blerrie!  No time to stay around... just get out of there, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_41_02">All right, snatch up those winch parts.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_87_01">Five</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_15_any_04">Get that gold wrapped up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_53_03">Friends, there must be a server room around there. Find it and we can open that gate.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_75_03">Kerels and Murky are attempting to stop the weapon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_26_03">Just 30 seconds to pickup!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_45_01">Friends, you should pile all your loot somewhere close, so that you can move it later, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_111_03">Quickly now, get inside the airlock!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_06_02">Now, just have a go at those logistics controls. It&apos;s a simple job. Even a retarded samango could do it. And sometimes they do, the little shits.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_intro_02">I gotta admit it&apos;s been awhile since I broke into a place this loudly. It&apos;s gonna be jol!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_91_03">Get on the helicopter now, time to go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_01_01">Remember, don&apos;t put on the mask. Case the place first.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_51_03">Hell, that&apos;s a sight! &quot;BFD&quot;. Or &quot;Big Funky Drill.&quot;.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_39_01">Ah, I&apos;m sure the airbag will save him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_22_01">Got him! Foggy Bottom!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_28_04">Bain, you&apos;re not gonna dies, yeah? You gotta set us straight on this Kataru business!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_intro_01_01">Alright, get ready! Get me the required amount of bags and I&apos;ll meet you at the safe house.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_07_02">Yep. Yeah. Alright, that checks out. Have a good day.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_21_any_02">Guys! Expecting delivery at dock seven!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_cnc_01">Chavez has a panic room filled with cash and we&apos;re gonna steal the whole room. Yes, you heard me correctly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_15_01">If you&apos;re low on Doctor Bags, you should consider getting that Infirmary open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_44_07">OK, where haven&apos;t you looked yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_93_01a">Oh blerrie hell. Find the keys to his car then! Let&apos;s just hope that pile of junk even starts!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_23_04">You just keep it up. This is text book stuff.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_67_02">The Murky resources we&apos;re after will be weapons. They could be anywhere around here, so you&apos;re just going to have to start looking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_70_02">Ahhh! There&apos;s a valuable prototype in that vault. It&apos;s in one of the crates, and not in the others. Open them to find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_i_04">We need hydrogen chloride!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_02_any_01">We need his phone, his tablet, his laptop and two external hard drives.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_end_c_01">That was an epic ass-kicking you just handed out, and you got the whole database. Let&apos;s hope I can find what we need to make the blood you spilt worth it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_02_any_04">Not much time people! Get those bags secured before the cops take &apos;em. The boat pick-up is coming.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_12_01">Keep defending Hoxton! If things are getting hairy, use cards to override the security barriers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_96_01">There&apos;s some fertilizer behind that gate. We&apos;ll need a blowtorch to cut through it. </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_05_07">Chloride. Hydrogen chloride.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_35_any_02">Three left!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_73_01">Still no alarms. Now get on the ship.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_66_01">Find the gear Micho planted somewhere. Look for a guitar case.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_25_03">Alright. Put the call through. Let me talk to the Feds.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_06_02">Not getting in that way, yeah? There&apos;s scaffolding on the outside. Should be a door on the 2nd floor you can hack through with a saw. </string>
	 <string id="pln_can_03_03">Don&apos;t go letting the cops mess with the elves.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_58_01">Get out of that damn lobby!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_87_01">Haha, it worked! The guards in security are sleeping like babies. Don&apos;t worry about cameras now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_69_03">ASIM - Check! We&apos;re on a roll! </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_08_03">So, the money is falling, for you. Good. Now, grab yourselves some parachutes and join it. Come on, my little angels.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_18_01">Nice night for a jol in the desert. Try to stay quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_end_a_01">You swept that bus clean of Mendozas. A true Viking funeral in flames with their possessions and all. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_05_any_02">Get inside - we need those cooks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_end_c_02">We&apos;re short on product so for now I think we&apos;re best keeping Hector in the dark. Maybe we can solve the issue another way. </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_27_03">Get those screws off that thing.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_23">Yeah, that&apos;s small army of police cars on our fucking tail!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_115_01">I just saw Ralph, go get him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_73_03">I loved chemistry in high school. By that, I mean I love stuff being blown up. Good work!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_05_03">Ensure all of the straps are secure. Don&apos;t give Locke an excuse to accidentally drop the money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_02_03">You&apos;re in trouble gang, Locke sold us out. You&apos;re going to have to fight your way out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_32_02">Just sneak through. Head downstairs to the garage.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_30_01">Find our Insider. She&apos;ll show you out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_05_02">Great. Now haul it back up to the Operations Room.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_18_01">We have half of needed fuel.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_34_02">They tied him down. We&apos;ll need to cut him loose.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_07_06b">Yo! Help!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_50_04">You still gotta hack into those access points.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_intro_01a">Nice, just like in one of those old black-and-white movies, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_05_03">An old... friend of mine in the FBI owed me a favor, so I got her to set up a laptop for us. She was going to hide its location on a whiteboard somewhere around there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_68_01">Time to start looking for that stash of Murky loot. It&apos;s drugs we&apos;re after. </string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_13_02">Good job. More cash is always welcome. Now, run back to the helicopter and get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_01x_02">Just give me...</string>
	 <string id="vld_nightclub_cnc_02">Once we party at my Tasteful club - big money, big times. Now we need to make big take from there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_105_02">Go on, connect those wires!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_32_01">Right, now just let it fill up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_83_01">If he&apos;s not in a cell, he might be in an interrogation room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_19_03">That&apos;s a nice haul of trick or treat goodies. Come home, gang, let&apos;s share it out!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_01_any_01">This is the boat.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_31_02">Don&apos;t forget to check the interrogation rooms. He might be in there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_94_01">Now grab as much of Vlad&apos;s merchandise as you can carry and get it out to the van!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_03_01">Was afraid of that. We didn&apos;t get in clean. The place is going into lockdown.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_08_any_01">There&apos;s a good chance there&apos;s a security camera in there. Keep an eye out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_40_02">Cops have messed with the time lock. Restart it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_13_03">That terminal will drop the bollards. Hack it.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_02_01">This job is important. The safes in those trucks, you need to get them out...uh, safely. You hear?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_51_03">Great. Now get the stuff. As much as you can, but at least a few bags.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_35_02">Good. We&apos;re done with the fourth floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_79_03">We&apos;re not going to be stopped by a gate now. Get it open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_33_03">Okay, both holes are drilled.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_06_06">You have to find the whiteboard while we still have time, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_07_to_arrival">The escape will be there in seven minutes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_32_01">Ach, you gotta get into that thing somehow. Wasn&apos;t really prepared for that.</string>
	 <string id="alm_bex_02_02">Out of my way! Hiyaaaaa!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_83_02">Maybe there&apos;s a saw in the garage.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_28_02">Inside that door you should find the safe.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_27_02">Don&apos;t stall. Just take him out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_70a_03">Get those things onto the plane, chop chop!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_cps_01a">Captain Smith, congratulations on your promotion. I&apos;m sure you&apos;re grateful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_40_02">The police shut of the main water pipe. You gotta get it running again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_08_03">That&apos;s the bluechip hired henchmen. </string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_intro_03">Let&apos;s get the goats in here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_17_02">Don&apos;t wait too long with that door, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_04_03">Where&apos;s that second truck? Gotta be around here somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_04_02">No time to brew coffee for that pissed old fart. Keep him safe. I&apos;m sending an extraction now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_46_any_01">Alright gentlemen! It&apos;s time to get the hell out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_63_01">There&apos;s a garbage truck waiting in the basement garage. Get down there and stash the loot there, quick!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_07_02">Don&apos;t make plans for that cash just yet. Remember we need to get it to the blackmailing asshole first. Don&apos;t worry, we&apos;ll find him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_end_02_02">Well done gentlemen! Some hard-earned cash!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_20_03">Get my cocaine!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_42_01">The vault with the artifact is behind these doors. You gotta get them open, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_98_01">Outstanding, guys, we&apos;re in! Help yourselves, give nothing back. Remember, our goal is the Dentists&apos; loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_83_01">One</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_11_03">Here I come. Hot fucking diggity fellas, you have a lot of pigs headed your way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_11_03">As the lady said, get searching these terminals I marked. One of them is bound to have the code we need.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_04_02">This shouldn&apos;t take long, hold your ground.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_102_01">Forget the alarms, gang, we&apos;re nearly done. Grab The Dentist&apos;s loot, and get it out of there. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_26_04">What are you waiting for? Get that keycard into the panel.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_77_02">This crate needs to be opened with a tool as well.</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_cnc_03">My brother-in-law crashed his plane in the woods. Get him back here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_41_02">It&apos;s like talking to a fucking Frenchman. Listen. If you want to use the service ladder in the diner, you need the keycard. Mon dieu!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_109_01">Helicopter is waiting.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_13_04">Gang, put those fires out. Don&apos;t want to risk him escaping in the chaos.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_01_01">Guys, it feels like something&apos;s in the air... Money!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_14_02">These Federal Kerels have got more interesting things than donuts and pie lying around- things we could get a pretty penny for to keep us going, so if you see something nice, go ahead and rop it. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_49_05">You need to shut off the lights, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_05_02">The wheel stopped on sniper. I&apos;m not sure what that means...</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_18_01">Hook me up to a phone somewhere and I&apos;ll see about getting the dear Commissioner out of his office.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_97_04">Check to make sure you get the right key!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_20_02">Look like Bain still has some strength, taking out that Murky. You&apos;ll need to drill through the door to get his keychain.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_27_05">What are you waiting for? That switch isn&apos;t gonna pull itself.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_51_03">Can&apos;t do anything until you help me through.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_08_any_01">They pulled the power, get it back on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_intro_b_02">Hector&apos;s worried. We&apos;re too far away from the coke in this chopper. Once you&apos;re on the ground, get the coke, signal the courier and load it onto the pick-up boat.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_14_any_01">The van will be there in about two minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_26_01">Just one more now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_22_02">Now move into the office, but stay quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_98_03">Get that red diamond and this&apos;ll be a double payday.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_20_any_04">Hey they might be workers but they&apos;re not dumb and blind - keep your profile low.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_93_03">This heist will go down in legend. I&apos;m already writing the wiki entry. It starts with &apos;Holy crap!&apos;</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_62_02">No, loitering friends. Take them all!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_79_01">Last gate! Get your tools on it and get it open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_21_01">That&apos;s perfect. The cage is assembled. Now load it, so we can get the money out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_can_intro_02">There&apos;s the &quot;toyshop&quot; right ahead.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_09_03">Nicely done, guys. Locke transferred our cut. I don&apos;t know about this guy, yet, but let&apos;s see how things pan out with him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_20_any_03">No, there&apos;s something wrong with this one, heading back to pick up another one...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_end_e_01">That&apos;s... A lot of money. I guess we&apos;re in the meth trade now. We really needed that information, though. Remember?  Saddle up and let&apos;s get those pricks - with or without the information.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_14_any_02">Great, you&apos;re in. One more door between us and the server. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_173_01">All right. Armory uses a three digit code. Look for it in the casino. Numbers and colors. Or you can gamble on guessing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_74_02">You need to draw some blood from the patient.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_12_02">Don&apos;t shoot that cop! It&apos;s three against one. Intimidate him to work for us instead.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_28_01">Bain, you chop... don&apos;t you dare die...</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_71_03">The vault&apos;s not going to open itself...</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_19_05">The domkops are trying to get off cheapsies with that offer, yeah? We can get more if we just don&apos;t give up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_40_02">Great! Now get it working on those trees!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_intro_03">Good luck on your treasure hunt, guys. And remember, keep it quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_intro_a_02b">Once you&apos;re in, find the crates and destroy them or bring them back. You want to do more, be my guest.</string>

	 <string id="loc_brb_26_03">You still need to bring the drill inside, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_04_01">Ah, blerrie. Of course it had to have a keylock. Maybe you can find some way to figure out the code in the clubhouse briefing room. Go have a look, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_02_03">Get it open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_50_02">Reckon that thermite is half-done. Just keep the pigs away.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_04_01">That will probably come in handy later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_17_01">Well, I&apos;ll be damned, you found a blowtorch. Now we can burn our way through the door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_27_any_03">OK, I&apos;m in. I&apos;ll get the lab door open in no time.</string>
	 <string id="plt_run_04_01">I can&apos;t pick you up with all these cops around here. You need to clear the area.</string>

	 <string id="pln_dah_25_03">Should be something just by the Velvet Room. There&apos;s a monitor on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_10_02">I sent a guy in earlier to take some seismic readings, and he was able to detect a lot of hollows in the ground. Makes me thing there are hidden passages in the building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_end_stealth_02">Great job keeping it quiet everyone. Almost worth shouting from the rooftops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_23_02">Ok guys. Get the crane to move the containers as we practiced.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_65_01">Hurry, get out of the PEOC!</string>

	 <string id="loc_jr1_41_02">We can get better acquainted later, but I feel now would be the opportune time to, how you say, GTFO, yes?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_00_03">You done? Good. Put on your mask now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_29_03">I think there&apos;s a computer in Sales. Go take a look.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_81_01">Maybe there&apos;s a utility closet or something nearby with a toolbox you can use. Go have a look.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_36_01">The pallet fell on the roof, huh? All right, so get on the roof. Look for a ladder.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_15_02">Some more cops have been called in. Be prepared! </string>

	 <string id="pln_pal_02_01">Mitchell&apos;s over by the pool.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_02w_01">Ok, here comes the second wave!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_22_03">Please, everyone into the airlock. The doors are designed so that the inner cannot open until the outer is closed.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_11_01">Very good, a silent kill. This is what happens to those who cross me.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_05">We got a tail - and they&apos;re getting closer!</string>
	 <string id="crn_man_02_03">I&apos;m connected.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_04_02">Good. Now use the other keycard on the panel in the other control room. </string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_58_02">Damn, looks like the only thing that will work now is the master code. Let me see if I can find out who has it.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_04_02">Hilary at Gensec here. Routine check. Can I have the time lock codes?</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_48_03">You need to secure the loot at the positions I&apos;ve marked.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_44_01">IRS making shady deals with the big corporations. Niiice, I feel like Robin Hood.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_40_03">Hurry up! The limo is burning up!</string>

	 <string id="pln_ca1_04_02">Oh, put some sleeping gas in there too. Don&apos;t leave it behind.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_09_01">It&apos;s supposed to be caustic soda, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_39_03">Great. Now, grab the loot. Let&apos;s finish this caper quiet like.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_34_01">Look at that. A lot of rich people up there, enjoying themselves.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_06_02">You can bet they&apos;re important if Vlad sent us to this hellhole for them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_96_04">You have to swap out those batteries.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_09_any_01">25 thousand, halfway guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_59_03">Hold your ears, you chops! It&apos;s going to be loud!</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_03_05">The goddamn fuck is taking so long? I&apos;m bleedin&apos; here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_46_03">Quickly, friends! Garrett&apos;s coming!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_03_02">You hear me? We need more fuel for ship to make international waters.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_04_02">Look for something to crack those crates open. </string>
	 <string id="sys_hb2_01_03">Clearance required.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_cnc_01_01">We&apos;re headed back to cook in the meth lab in the forest. None of Hector&apos;s shit this time. This is just for profit.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_19_05">Do you know I work for the Continental?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_99_03">Get that key to the car!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_13_any_02">OK, OK, I&apos;m done with the security hack, everything&apos;s unlocked.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_01d">Wish we had a better idea of exactly what we&apos;re looking for.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_52_01">Come on, jump down into the vault!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_10_02">The ladder and thermite are right there. Don&apos;t forget them. </string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_01_02">Buluc has a wine cellar that will give you access to the mansion. Go to it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_109_05">Stop messing around and get on board.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_31_03">Take a look around and see if you can find a clue on how to crack that code. Check the workstations.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_23_02b">Sweet Mother Mary, please let me live another day... I&apos;m a good boy, aren&apos;t I?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_14_06">Move that out of the way to a good place, then get back to it, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_02_01">I got Vlad on the line.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_02_03">What sort of noise?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_55_02">There it goes. Let it do its thing.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_15_03">Get to Twitch, he&apos;s in the parking lot!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_102_02">The helicopter is coming. Just hold on a little longer!</string>

	 <string id="cpt_wwh_05_03">Hose needs to connect with pump now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_13_03">There&apos;s plastic explosive in the DeLorean. Set it on the Commissar&apos;s gas station, and make it go up like Sputnik!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_43_01">That&apos;s the head of security. He&apos;s by the pools.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_02_02">Just fight to the front of the plane, up the stairs and then all the way back. It&apos;s the only way to reach those controls.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_73_03">They still don&apos;t know you&apos;re there. Get on the ship. Keep it quiet.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_65_02">Your escape has arrived! Get out!</string>

	 <string id="pln_hlp_26_01">Place that keycard</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_40_03">That&apos;s a lot of shiny. Worth a fortune, but we just have to get it open. See if you can find any clues to those symbols around there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_14_05">The evidence has to be here somewhere!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_01_02">Okay, guys, this is a good spot. You almost have a clear view of the train yard. Keep track of the patrolling guards and cameras.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_63_03">This office has a basement garage. A garbage truck is waiting for the bags. Get down there, and get them secured!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_42_03">Could be those safe deposit boxes have some extra valuables we can use, yeah? Maybe you can get into them while you wait for the vault to open?</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_13_any_03">OK, get the bags into the truck! He is close to that yellow crane.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_end_b_01">OK, guys - that was some heavy lifting! The right engine has been delivered and is now locked away. Our payday is coming up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_69_02">C&apos;mon friends, get onboard!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_43_01">Ah! Yes, I believe that ladder will be useful!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_108_01">Ah, you got it wrong. Maybe bringing hazmat suits would have been a good idea. Wait until it stops reacting, then try again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_63_02">That should do it. He won&apos;t be back soon. Thank the culinary spirits for bad chili, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_25_02">Start hacking, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_27_01">No need to wait. Get it done, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_brief_a_01">This town is a great place to fence jewelry.  Easy to move. Diplomats and trophy wives buying it, no questions asked. This is going to be cake. Let&apos;s get going.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_15_01">The guard rotation is changing, so there might be more coming soon. Keep a lookout, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_129_01">It would give me a lot of pleasure to assist you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_109_03">Don&apos;t let the cops near the cage. Those sneaky bastards can walk off with your hard-earned cash.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_45_any_01">Mr Dr Fantastic Sir! You nailed it. Thats some science - well done team. Get your big brains out of there! Use the plane.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_01_03">It&apos;s a dirty job, but if it means we stay in a job...</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_41_03">Let me remind you. Look for a keycard if you want to get access to the roofs. Kak...</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_intro_04_01">Why do you keep going bossies over Bain? Look, we&apos;ve got it under control, yeah?$NL;</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_42_02">Quick work, friends. You got ahead of old Locke, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_16_02">That&apos;s the list. Now get back to IT and upload it from an online terminal.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_102_05">Keep preparing the right chemicals.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_54_02">That looks right. Grab them and put them on the door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_30_02">The Mongol&apos;s were great warriors. Would love to see them in action.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_13_08">Give me a second to check...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_115_03">Ship&apos;s there. Get on it! Maybe deploy the zip-line - might speed things up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_09_02">Anything could be on that server. Maybe the President&apos;s email address.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_64_02">Put in on the floor!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_26_01">Crap! It missed the cable. Alright, don&apos;t panic. He&apos;s swinging around for another pass.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_10_02">Finders keepers, gang. Finders keepers.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_09_01">Don&apos;t be shy of the explosives, friends. C4 good. C4 is friend, yes?</string>

	 <string id="pln_flt_09_02">Go to the panic room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_28_03">A bit hairy in the end but you got there. I don&apos;t think we could have gotten another penny from those chops. Nice work!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_79_03">Gotta get into that vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_wwh_02_02">Farewell dear friends, we&apos;ll not meet again I think!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_15_03b">Hmm... Yup, there&apos;s no way around it. I&apos;m gonna need to get into the garage and take apart one of the bikes there. Only way to get the stuff I need. Take me there and cover my ass while I work.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_20_01">There are clearly things missing. You probably need to find them to open the door. Have a look around.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_03_03">That&apos;s the last box. Cutting the power. Done! Lasers are down! Move on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_brief_01">Now Hector tells me we need to hit the Mendozas themselves for information. Where they keep their money, in fact.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_09_02">Good. Temperature is climbing faster. Must be something hot in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_13_01">That&apos;s all of it. We&apos;ll make some good money from all this fancy stuff. Head back to the chopper and get out of there now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_152_03">It&apos;s... room...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_07_01">That&apos;s the right panel. Now search for the other keycard. Get the other panel activated.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_30_03">Supposedly, it was Genghis that found the Diamond. He did pretty well out of it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_05_02">Get it to the van!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_41_03">First control room. The other is across the dock. You see it?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_16_03">Nicely done, friends. Now you can go open that door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_52_03">Come on, get that hack going again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_43_03">We can piss on his bones later. Right now, we gotta deal with the evidence littered throughout the house.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_13_02">Chopper&apos;s here. Get on it.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap06_01">Hello?</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_13_03">Come on, we have to get the shoes with the cocaine!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_32_02">Grab as much gas as you can.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_36_03">Don&apos;t believe Duke&apos;s superstitions... get to the archaeology lab.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_08_06">Thank you. I&apos;ll get out of this yet.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_30_01">Time to juice up that plane. Get the fuel hose connected. </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_02_03">Out of there, come on!</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_05_04">I am sure that they are very safe. But, regardless, make sure you enjoy every day of what life remains to you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_28_02">There you you go, well done. We squished those kerels for every last penny. Tonight, old Locke buys the drinks, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_14_03">That did the trick, good job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_09_03">The panic is on the third floor. Get over there. </string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_01_01">The fuck is going on? Some motherfucker sold us out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_73_01">That explosion will have it raining crystals for weeks. </string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_51_03">When you&apos;re ready to get out of here, answer the intercom. Our guy will get the loot out, so make sure you&apos;ve secured what you wanna take.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_58_any_04">Another two minutes and I&apos;m out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_11_02">That&apos;s it for the sneaking. Thankfully, crowd didn&apos;t hear a thing.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_48b_03">One more hack should reset the lockdown.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_61_02">OK, make sure he gets to the server room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_36_03">Hmm... not sure where this entrance is exactly, but if you poke around a bit, maybe you can find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_167_03">All You Can Eat, remember. Just 18 bucks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_03">Damn! They just flushed another bag of cocaine! Hurry, gang! Get up to the last floor!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_52_02">Kak! Some sloppy bastard forgot to refuel the chopper. Hook up the fuel, would you?</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_50_03">We just did something people would have said was impossible. There&apos;s nothing we can&apos;t do, gang. Best of the best.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_20_any_04">We got eight! </string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_11_02">Goddamn cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_27_01">The cops have disconnected the hose. Reconnect it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_32_03">Any more loot? You gotta secure it in the tree now, before Bile flies it out of here!</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_18_02">Fire warning just lit up. Sheeeeeeeeeit. Get it out, now!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_03_06">I need you to take those snipers out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_103_02">The symbols. There&apos;s a correct order to them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_28_01">Remember, stash the loot in the vent.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_g_06">My bad. It&apos;s muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_38_02">Good, the scan is under way again.</string>
	 <string id="geo_glc_03_01">I&apos;m here, picking up the package.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_06_02">The bank is not going to heist itself.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_10_03">Great work! Now breach those doors.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_58_01">I&apos;ve got twitch coming with the van for you, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_05_06">Are you all feeling okay? If you suffer radiation poisoning, I send you flowers and grapes.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap07_06">What the fuck is going on? Don&apos;t I pay you enough to keep these things from happening?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_08_01">Alright, the data scrambling is done. It&apos;ll just look like a regular hard drive failure. </string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_40_02">You need to get that explosive cocktail together.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_cbf_01_02">Gensec are a big security company on the East Coast. Got a great reputation with the banks and politicians, but today we&apos;re going to see what we can do about that. Got a tip-off about a convoy coming into the city. We&apos;re going after it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_31_02">C&apos;mon, get in the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_13_02">Stick a blocker on the keypad to stop the code cycle.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_16_03">And that is the end. Comrade Asshole is dead. Chopper is in-bound. Great work today. The Dentist, and Hoxton, will thank you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_06_03">Good. Let&apos;s see... it says here they have physical evidence on our friend as well.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_24_01">OK. Get access to their comm relay. We&apos;re gonna make it look like we&apos;re making a call from the house.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_08_02">Ok the wheel landed on flames again, watch out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_09_02">OK good. Time to check the vault in the back office guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_57_05">Keep looking for the evidence room on the second floor!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_20_01">Hot damn! You guys did great! Enjoy your payday - you deserve it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_76_07">They won&apos;t let that gun alone if you&apos;re not there, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_04_02">Find the head of security and get his USB stick.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_05_any_01">OK, that&apos;s around 5000 dollars.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_16_any_01">There&apos;s a SWAT helicopter on the roof.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_13">We got a fucking police caravan on our ass!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_37_02">Got a drill and some thermite hidden in the copy machine in the server room. Go get it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_06_any_01">That seems to be a keycard, we can probably use that later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_33_any_01">Alright, we are in. Find the correct working fusion engine. Check his notes. Figure it out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_60_03">Don&apos;t wait around too long, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_23_any_01">Ah, I see you already took care of the security boxes. Planning ahead, I like this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_garage_01_any_02">What the hell just happened?! Just grab the loot and look alive! The cops are moving in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_08_07">It should be acid.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_21">The cops are right on top of us!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_88_any_01">I got snipers incoming. Stay indoors guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_30_02">Hurry now... find those walkway controls.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_119_01">Taking out the trash, eh?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_22_03">You need to clear that car.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_21_03b">Done! Get me the next piece!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_49_05">Hey boss. There&apos;s some woman here, says she has some important information for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_72_01">Ha, they still suspect nothing. Just stay careful while the ship is moving.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_13_02">The alarm shut down the time lock. Stay cool. There&apos;s a maintenance office on the roof. Get there. We should be able to rewire it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_59_02">OK, let&apos;s see if I can open the vault now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_66_01">Get out of there, unless you feel like taking along some trinkets.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_08_03">Oh yeah, there it is. Get the gate open and secure the BCI headset and the software.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_25_02">If we could get our hands on a hard drive, we might be able to hack the system to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_43_01">Sure. Please hold.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_25_01">What the hell? That&apos;s the wrong elevator. Hold on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_03_05">Try not to be late guys, don&apos;t want to look unprofessional.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_05_01">That was easy enough. Not surprising, considering any old chop can get in! </string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_07_03">That&apos;s the cash. Remember, unless you want the cops there, get a bag over the yellow wall. Don&apos;t worry - that blackmailing asswipe will get what&apos;s coming to him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_22_03">That&apos;s it! The EMP did its job! Now enter the laboratory via the hatch.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_18_02">What are you waiting for, you chops? Get to the Oval Office!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_67_01">Ach! They cut the power! Get it up again, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_06_any_01">Great! Now hook me up!</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_18_01">Shit! Somethings burning over there. Get that fire out, quick!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_16_02">He&apos;s dead. Good riddance. Chopper&apos;s on the way, guys. Dentist sent a few bottles of champagne with it. Sure Hoxton will be grateful too. Good work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_57_01">Damn! The Alarm timer ran out. It&apos;s not rocket science, people!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_166_03">You can get a side of cornbread with that. Yummy!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_106_01">Get ready for takeoff!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_11_02b">Beautiful bikes are all about the details, and I know Rust wants the best for his baby. They have a special made chrome skull inside the clubhouse. Go fetch.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_11_03">The evidence storage is on the second floor. Go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_24_01">If you need more gear, have another look at the drop site, friends.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_03_01">Guys, it feels like something&apos;s in the air... Money!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_06_08">Cover me so I can get the gate open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_13_01">Looks like I found one for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_22_06">There&apos;s a little coke left! Step on it and you might just earn a little extra! Just might!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_03_any_01">OK, OK, we gotta change this up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_62_03">C&apos;mon, take all the pardons. You need to leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_01_03">First thing to do is get inside. Front door is the most obvious way, but maybe you can figure out something less conspicuous.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_21_01">The door&apos;s locked. See if you can find another way out so we can keep going forward.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_116_01">Moretta. This is Port Washington radio. One zero one E. Over.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_intro_01_01">Oh... Wow. Hope those wagons survived.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_16_any_02">Ouch - that sure drew attention.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_10_03">Motherfuckin&apos; pigs got Brown!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_74_03">And still no-one knows you&apos;re there. Keep it that way. Find those explosives.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_intro_02">You&apos;re almost there, everyone get your guns ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_end_b_01">You guys can cook! Which one of you is Heisenberg, Hector wants to know.  </string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_14_01">Just throw the bags into one of the containers on the floor. I&apos;ll send...someone to pick it up later.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_68_02">The drill has stopped. You gotta restart it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_106_02">Prep the next part, and hope nothing bad happens.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_46_03">Yeah, we&apos;re gonna need a crowbar. See if you can find one. </string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_36_05">Don&apos;t leave him tied up longer than necessary!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_07_03">There are circuit boxes around the place. Disabling them will shut down the metal detectors.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_12_01">The countdown has started. Keep the police off the detonator, yes? No snippy-snip!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_112_02">Ok, now just down the ramp and out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_14_03">Damn, those warheads are heavy. Maybe use the forklifts.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_45_02">Back to the dock. Each keycard will open a gate. One for each control.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_59_03">Sweet, you guys got it down - now go for the loot inside the safe!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_21_any_01">Get the last one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_02_01">The vault is going to be in one of these Murkywater shipping containers. Check them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_45_01">Swats are coming in from the north, on Keel Street.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_08_01">Find that key tag yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_06_02">Keep an eye on whichever of you is carrying the server. Make sure they get back safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_22_01">Wait, STOP! It&apos;s electrified!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_07_01">So, joke over, right? This just big joke? Dont do this!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_08a_03">Good. Now get a breaker on the second code lock.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_81_01">Take that door breaker to the cell block door. I&apos;m sure it will do the job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_102_03">That&apos;s about halfway done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage3_05_any_01">The money is yours to take. If you have the codes you will be able to defuse the planted C4s.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_09_03">Great. Look at that temperature climb. Sheesh, must be something hotter than hell in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_15_03">Use their own toys against them - I love it. Now get inside the lumber mill.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_32_04">Move the box to the entrance with the conveyor in the central hub, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_48_03">That keycard opens the dock gate. Use it in the control room. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_43_03">Sounds like the SWAT killed the engine. Get her moving again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_11_03">Now return to the terminal and give it a kickstart.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_16_03">Great. Now let&apos;s get her that GPS data. Find the computer to upload.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_39_01">Hey! Don&apos;t destroy the tree!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_06_01">Good. Now, drop the charges at the main door over there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_52a_01">The power has been cut. Find the breaker and turn it on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_01_03">We&apos;re here, guys. Up ahead is Chavez&apos; place.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_81_03">Good! Now take that door breaker to the cell block door!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_40_01">There&apos;s a service ladder leading to the roof. You&apos;ll need a keycard to access it though. Got to be one here somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_72_01">OK, now you need that keycard. Find our birthday boy Ralph, he&apos;s probably still hiding somewhere!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_42_01">That&apos;s the head of security. He seems to be at the back of the house.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_84_02">OK, now turn it on and keep those dwankie federales away from it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_01_02">Cook meth. Same as always.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_24_any_01">The prototypes should be in the lab. To gain access to it we need to hack the main server. Find the server room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_51_any_02">It&apos;s getting there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_13_any_01">Watch out for that chopper, it&apos;s close enough for the cops to do him some good damage.</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_07_05">Hey, keep those elves working! Offer them a performance reward. They perform, and I won&apos;t fucking skin them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_requirement_04_bags">Remember guys, we need four bags to escape.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_13">Don&apos;t think about running again, or it&apos;s the stewpot for you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_08_01">That&apos;s the first stash. Three to go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_68_04">Have you found the control panel yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_11_01">Careful though, don&apos;t get discovered.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_38_03">Friends, some Batmanuel is not going to come jumping in the window to help. You gotta take care of those lasers yourselves!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_13_05">Deal with the fires, crew. </string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_04_01">Keep the cops off the drill.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_71_01">Looks like the vault in the blueprint you found.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_46_03">That&apos;s right! I almost forgot: there is a briefcase in the laboratory. I&apos;m gonna need you to get it, guys. It&apos;s important.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_03_any_01">We want at least two bags of jewels from this store. Understand?</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_02">Motherfuckers!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_96_01">OK, Vlad seems happy. You can leave at your discretion, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_55_03">The Mayan door... use that codex to open it! Just need to find the right symbols. Look for more info!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_22_any_01">And... Alex made the requested drop. Somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="plt_run_05_01">Ok, great. I&apos;m coming in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_77_01">Great, now you just gotta hold out &apos;till it gets there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_08_03">All right. Yeah, this is good. Going to need more, though.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_27_02">That&apos;s the streetlight done. Now grab that goat!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_16_03">Second closet. Good. Get it open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_55_03">Guys, the radar is still operational? You need to destroy it. Use the explosives Bile dropped!</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_12_01">Fuck this shit, I&apos;m bailin&apos;!</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_02_01">Seems the paintings are not enough. We must hit him harder.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_end_a_03">You clowns just wrote the most exciting chapter in the story of Washington politics, and probably the most honest. Great work!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_end_a_01b">Lets make sure we get our gold - it&apos;s our payday too.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_76_01">You&apos;ll need to hack the door. Place the hacking device!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_71_02">That&apos;s another vault open and ready. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_11_03">Boom! Great job, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_113_03">Vault is open. New plan. Just stroll in and get to work. Easy money!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_08_02">Come on friends. Andalé or whatever they say down there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_cps_01d">Nothing happened here. Can you do it? Ok, great. Let me know when it&apos;s done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_11_02">That&apos;s the turret recovered. Give me a moment. Your pick-up is on its way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_19_any_02">Very smart to use the tunnels like that - very professional.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_16_05">Don&apos;t forget about the prisoner, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_13_any_02">They are coming in from the forest next to the road! Keep them away!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_20_01">That&apos;s the last door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_29_03">Could never go wrong with that, I guess. Might be somewhere it can be useful later.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_01_03">Cars... okay, can do. What&apos;s your position?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_05_01">Great, now plug the usb into the computer. Look for a laptop, it should be near the house.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_21_any_01">Careful with the cameras!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_59_04">Friends, let the timelock go tick-tock, yeah? Your patience will be rewarded.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_10_02">Here&apos;s the new plan. I&apos;m altering the hack to make it look like this whole enterprise is for Mayor Schwartz instead. It&apos;s a dirty trick, but this is politics.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_07_10">Blerrie!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_12_02">Next time you&apos;ll have to pay for these kind of &quot;special&quot; favors. My contacts risk their asses and they expect some good cash in return.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_20_04">The cell block is nearby. That&apos;s where they&apos;ll be keeping our friend.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_18_03">See the yellow waste chute on the side of the construction tower? You can throw the loot in there and I&apos;ll have someone pick it up later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_96_01">Units converging on your position from all directions. Cops, SWAT, Feds and - hell! Even the National Guard are on they way. We need to find another way out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_01_01">OK, make your way inside. Keep it quiet. </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_54_03">Good, now get them onto the door!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_30_04">These Coyopa shitheads buy a lot of nice cars with their money. You can steal one from the garage to escape with.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_21_01">Man, this case goes a lot further than just me. There&apos;s references to all you guys in here. No names though. Guess our rat is sitting on those.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_81_03">It&apos;s not going to be like on TV where you drive through the doors. Use the button!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_16_02">Get that cage built before you deal with the money.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_19_05">C&apos;mon, stop loitering about and get to finding that phone.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_27_01">Coppers got to the drill!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_65_03">You gotta see that the kerels don&apos;t interrupt, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_misc_sj_dgh_04_02">Good job. Leave them there for now while we take care of the bank. </string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_04_03">Cover me while I open the gate!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_26_01">Ok, let&apos;s see how he reacts to this.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_98_02">The lasers have been triggered. You need to shut the security system down, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_33_02">Some nice loot in these displays. But some cheap counterfeit crap too. Look for alarms. That&apos;ll mark the good stuff.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_26_03">Get ready to drop Floyd. Yeah, I named him Floyd.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_10_02">Don&apos;t be scared. Just jump!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_47_01">The drill can&apos;t be dropped through that skylight barrier. Gotta open it from the security center.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_15_02">Getting some unusual interference on the network, but I&apos;m almost there.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_19_01">What took you so long?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_25_03">Are you fucking stupid? I said strap the money to the chopper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_55_01">There&apos;s a locker room by the reception. Get there and get into some scrubs.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_68_05">Hurry friends, get that dinges charged.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_06_02">Well done. You move silently.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_03_03">You&apos;ll find the coke in the manager&apos;s office but it will be guarded, so stay on your toes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_10_02">More cops! Give &apos;em hell!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_36_03">Now get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_06_02">Get him in the back!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_32_02">There is an access door to the PEOC near the library. Get back there and find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_27_01">You did it! The Diamond! And the goddamn Payday Gang. You just wrote yourselves into history, gentlemen.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_59_02">What are you doing? Be gentle!</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_08_06">Who has the strongest back? Come on, show your Uncle Vlad how well you can carry!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_50_01">There you go, that&apos;s it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_01_01">OK, friends. Let&apos;s get some cooking started. Old Locke isn&apos;t the best cook in the world, so maybe, don&apos;t sample the goods, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_21_01">Keep moving!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_intro_01">What... it&apos;s Matt Roscoe! Of course that weasel had to be involved! Maybe you should just kill him here and now!</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap07_03">Miguel! Get Mike and come find me. The fucking Payday gang is here. </string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_01_01">Okay, gang. The train yard is right in front of you. There should be several ways you can infiltrate the place, so make your choices wisely.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_har_02_01">Sorry about the accommodations, but it will be worth it. We got two trucks out there. As soon as the doors open, hit them hard!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_49_01">The tunnel entrance should be outside somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_56_03">All right, now start stashing that money in the vent!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_07_07">Sorry friends, that wasn&apos;t right.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_55_03">First step is getting inside the station.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_02_03">How can the cops arrest Santa Claus? It&apos;s not right!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_14_01">You know what to do. Get out there. Assemble the cage!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_29_03">Take some more things or leave. Your call.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_18_02">Time to eject! The escape van is parked near the main entrance!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_26_03">Gotta wonder who has the resources to back the Dentist in all this. Is he the top of the food chain, or is there more to this braai?</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_08_02">And... bam! </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_34_02">Maybe I should&apos;ve studied this ancient stuff more. Could the curse be true? Ah, it&apos;s just old shit worth money to me.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_84_02">What&apos;s this? Might be worth a look, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_59_02">BFD does things in her own time. Let her deal with the vault, you deal with cops getting near her.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_intro_b_01">Well the cops are all over the pick-up. I told Alex to set you down further away so you could claim the coke from a safer position. Once you have it, signal the boat and hustle the coke onboard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_24_02">That&apos;s it for the snipers, gang. Nothing will stop Bile from dropping the C4 now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_04_01">The metal detectors should be down now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_33_any_03">Hold them in position.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_81_03">Fantastic, friends. Now you need to get back to the entrance so that I can pull you out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_61_03">Escort the dwankie to the server room!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_32_02">Now wait for the winches to work. And make sure they&apos;re not interfered with.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_11_02">The Dentist tells me the Russkie&apos;s move a lot of meth out of this dump. I&apos;m guessing they&apos;re brewing it up in one of those upper floor rooms. Wrecking that would get the Commissars attention.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_38_03">The scan is back in progress. Now keep it that way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_20_01">There is a lot of construction in this area. Check it out and see if you can find something to help us tackle that steel gate.</string>
	 <string id="plc_cs1_02_01">This is Captain Rogers again, Look, the officers I dispatched are not responding. Is there a problem?</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_02_03">You need to make your way to the front of the plane, gang. Then up the stairs, and all the way back. Only way to get to the controls.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_12_any_01">Shit, the cops are here!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_04b_any_02">... getting closer!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_05d_02">Nice work! The fifth wave was beaten back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_end_b_01">Well I guess the whole keep a low profile is now out of the question. On the other hand, even bad publicity is good publicity, and we got what we came for. Well done. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrasch_stage1_end_a_02">Mall destruction: check. Pissed off police: check. Let&apos;s go get paid from old Vlad.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_63_02">She&apos;s all done! Quickly, down into the vault!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_08_01">Great. The money is in the sky! Drifting down exactly where I want it to. Like a million-dollar snowflake. Oh, and grab the parachutes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_21_01">Ok, he&apos;s got a lot of fancy art around here. Must be worth a fortune. We&apos;ll gather &apos;em in a pile and burn &apos;em, that should draw him out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_03_01">There should be four prison transports on the scene.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_04_any_01">That&apos;s the address! We&apos;ve got what we need. Get back to the van and we can get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_46_02">That&apos;s one shiny piece of carbon.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_intro_01b">Almost there... aaaand....</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_133_03">Look out for those turrets, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_60_03">Ah kek, not again. Maybe a midnight snack will do it. Find some food and set it outside Garrett&apos;s door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_51_any_01">The escape van is ready, go when you&apos;re good!</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_04_07">Why does this bloody feel like the end of the world?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_58_01">Come one friends, throw the cocktail on the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_25_01">Right, now you got to get it open. See if you can find a tool around there somewhere to help do the job, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_36_02">Just a heads up: the type of security they use for the server room will make it harder to open if there&apos;s an active ECM jammer nearby.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_37_any_01">Now hopefully they won&apos;t notice anything. Because we&apos;re just that lucky.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_14_01">Don&apos;t&apos; forget to blow up that floor, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_06_04">I&apos;d appreciate some protection while I work on the gate!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_24_03">Hack the computer and see if you can find the code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_10_any_01">Great job, I&apos;ve got connection!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_29_any_01">Get the bags to the van to secure them. Don&apos;t let the cops run away with your hard earned meth!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_13_02">The police are suspicious and are calling the house. Stay put.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_81_04">Push button. Doors open. Pretty simple.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_55_02">No more time to party, just get out.</string>
	 <string id="plt_mad_intro_03">Anti-air defenses?! Are you shitting me?! I can&apos;t fly any further! Take the parachutes and jump out! </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_67_01">Time to start looking for that stash of Murky loot. It&apos;s weapons we&apos;re after. </string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_25_02">Come on, Bile, what the hell? Sorry about that, guys, you&apos;ll still have to pick up the C4 and place them all around the floors above the panic room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_41_02">Hey, there he is. Looks like he&apos;s by the docks.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_10">Stay there, or it&apos;s the halal butcher for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_03_any_01">They&apos;re pretty antsy - just get the paintings on the table and keep both eyes open for anything weird.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_79_02">Go ahead and take the box, friends. Keep the kerels away from it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_06_03">Bring hose and connect to ship.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_h_06">My bad. It&apos;s caustic soda.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_22_02">See if you can find Buluc&apos;s secret meeting room. The solution for getting into his office should be there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_40_01">Good, now it&apos;s time to leave. Get onboard that dinges, quickly!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_44_01">Delaware Popcorn!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_83_02">There you go, now do the last one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_13_03">We&apos;re going to need a thermal lance to get through that thing. Looks like the Fed&apos;s really want this guy kept alive. Bile is in-bound.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_11_any_01">It&apos;s done! Open the lab door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_22_any_06">I&apos;m just guessing at this point... These internet descriptions are iffy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_17_any_02">You guys OK? Bikers sure act like it is war - go get &apos;em!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_cnc_01_02">We&apos;re going to the Teuer dealership. It&apos;s a high-end place.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_70_03">Carry the box back to the skylight where you entered, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_27_02">Now, ditch the bags into the vent by the elevators. They&apos;ll be fine, don&apos;t worry.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_15_01">Something wrong with that computer. It&apos;s not connecting. Damn MurkyDOS. Try another one. </string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_73_02">First thing to do is get to the West Wing and find the Oval Office!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_05_06">How about hydrogen chloride.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_07_any_01">15,000 dollars worth of stuff.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_34_01">Look at that beauty. It&apos;s called The Beast. Now start it up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_85_03">The code begins with a four, according to my source.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_14">Death by meth...</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_21_01">Keep looking for those cells.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_34_01">The streets are crawling with cops! Not getting out that way. Light a flare and I&apos;ll bring in a chopper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_24_01">You gotta get those police cars out of the way so the escape van can move in!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_122_01">You gotta help me get it working again, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_26_05">Kidnapping? That dirty Russki has no boundaries.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_21_02">Okay, package is on the floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_06_02">We&apos;re in. Now look for the EMP parts.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_10_01">I bet one of the guards has left a keycard somewhere. Look around.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_17_03">Use the keycard you picked up and enter the room. Just be ready to silence anyone inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_38_any_01">Snipers across the alley!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_04_01">Move it guys. Follow that gold.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_79_03">Take that box friends, and make sure no one else gets their greasy paws on it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_102_02">OK, now you can take all of Vlad&apos;s jewelry. The truck you wanted is waiting outside!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_44_01b">What are you up to, Vlad?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_15_02">Sniper! Take cover!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_intro_01_03">There you go, armored transport served on a silver platter, just open her up and secure the loot.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_02_01">There we go. I&apos;ll be nearby and ready when you need me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_par_02_01">Bullseye! You guys OK? That was one hell of a collision! Get to work on those transports!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_12_02">They recently hired a new IT guy. If we can get into his computer, I should be able to get that door open. Look for some clue to who this guy is, and find his PC.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_26_03">Remember, you need to get a saw on the streetlight to bring down the goat.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_72_02">Dwankie cops have stopped the hack! Get it going again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_14_02">No time to load the chopper. It&apos;s just going to grab the truck, so you need to be inside!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_54_03">It&apos;s probably on the bottom floor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_11_03">One of the items we are here for is being kept in the warehouse archive. You can use the crane in the central hub to get it, once you find the right shelf.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_127_01">Aaand done! On to the next one...</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_03_01">Now don&apos;t forget to tell the guys to be brutal. Make Buluc suffer real good.$NL;Maybe have Jiro samurai-chop his balls or something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_80_03">Just a few more steps, gang. The ladder is right ahead.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_09_any_02">Blueprints - perfect. Well done.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_27_01a">Why is it taking so long?</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_end_a_01b">I&apos;ll get in touch with the senator&apos;s people and talk &apos;em into buying the paintings from us.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_64_01">We&apos;re here! Find The Dentist&apos;s loot, and let&apos;s get it out of here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_87_03">Those kerels will kill the Beast if you let them get too close!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_84_03">Rust said something about this... see if you can find anything useful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_50_01">There should be a button or something that opens the safe. Look around.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_15_02">That&apos;s how we do it! Good job, guys. Get inside the mill now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_49_02">Don&apos;t klock him in the head, just find the circuit box!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_05">More coke just got flushed. That stuff is uncut - it&apos;s worth a fortune. Get up there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_end_a_03">If you can&apos;t stand the heat get out of the kitchen eh? Well done. We got enough meth to deal with Hector. Let&apos;s get back in town. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_23_01">Alright. Let the driver know you&apos;re ready to move.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_107_01">That&apos;s one of the cards for the vault. Remember, once you have used it, you&apos;ll need to find another.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_27_03">Keep looking around the place, gang. Somewhere there&apos;s something that can help nail the Commissars exact location.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_20_01">There you go, that&apos;s the location. Now get out to the control room and pull it out of storage with the crane.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_08_03">Just a little longer.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_64_03">The getaway plane is probably in one of the hangars. Go have a look!</string>
	 <string id="dlg_pln_bb1_intro_01_01">Security here is tight. We might be able to do this heist silently. But if things go loud, don&apos;t worry. I&apos;ve always got a Plan B.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_65_02">No standing around. Find the plane, quickly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_40_03">Fantastic! No time to lose, though. Fire it up and get felling those trees.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_05_01">Great! That&apos;s one of our voting machines! Hack it when there&apos;s no one nearby. If they see what you&apos;re up to, things will get loud.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_08_any_01">Guys, the first batch is unloaded - I&apos;m coming back for more!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_100_03">You need to get back to the entrance so that I can pull you out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_16_03">Remember, if you don´t get that cage assembled we can&apos;t move the cash. Get it done!</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_14_02">Ah, Is... just... you know, some jewels and things.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_02_01">Look around. Search the Murkywater containers. Just grab any valuables you can.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_13_01">Nicely done, friends. </string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_04_any_01">That should do it, you can place the drill now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_86_01">Four</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_15_any_01">We&apos;re about a minute away.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_33_01">That&apos;s the second color and number.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_07_01">Take a look around the office while you wait for the drill. Might be some other loot we can take.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_34_any_05">Close... Come on folks... Getting there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_24_03">And...voila!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_12_any_03">Check. Alarm on that door is off. Get inside now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_22_02">There&apos;s no getting through that thing quietly with tools, so you&apos;ll have to find a code for it.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_48_any_12">You still have 16 left!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_09_01">If you move across the roof into the next building, I can meet you there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_19_01">Connect me to a telephone, friends</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_20_02">Get the shoes with my cocaine!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_11_any_04">Stop throwing the coke into the fucking water!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_94_03">The ladders are a weakpoint. Don&apos;t let the cops get up them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_54a_03">Electrical light fixtures are good places for hiding things...</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_01_any_03">Boat driver here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_55_02">Looks like you found the server room, friends. If you can find an IT support tech, you could make him disable the security lock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_21_01">Good job. Now lets get moving.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_16_02">You heard the Cap&apos;n. Get the GPS data to the Moretta. Find the computer to upload.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_25_01">Get that keycard into the panel and pull that switch. Let&apos;s see what happens.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_23_03">Turning this crate around. Just gimme 60 seconds.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_99_01">The weapon is ready, so hit the fire button and melt that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_key_01_01">A security door? Damn. Well, one of the guards must have a key of his own!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_13_01">153!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_13_02">Good, good. No mistakes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_45_any_03">Damn it! I think you just tripped the cameras.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_70_02">Come on, get that fire going!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_34_02">Found anything yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_160_04">This is... Gerd. I&apos;m calling you from The Golden Grin Customer Satisfaction Department.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cs1_17_02">Broadsword, the package is safe. Repeat: package is safe. Over and out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_62_01">The elephant specifically told me not to forget the briefcase! Find it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_24_02">The door is opening! Good! Now, if you would be so kind, please storm the inner complex.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_08_04">These Californians are so rude. Teach them some DC manners.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_15_03">See if there&apos;s a car around there. Sooner you get those shady Russian nukes to Vlad&apos;s train the better!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_41_02">The pardons will be in the vault, so I need you to take a look at it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_77_02">The hacking was interrupted. Get on it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_09_03">Would be great to burn through those bars, if you can find something suitable.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_48_02">Haha, you read my mind, guys. I do want that briefcase.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_18_02">Find me a telephone around there and I&apos;ll try to get Mr. Garrett to take a little walk or something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_13_01">Get that shoe box, guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_02_02">This will be a tough one but you can handle it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_44_01">Guys, we needed the boss alive to open the panic room quietly! Alright. We&apos;re gonna have to do this the loud way now.</string>
	 <string id="rb1_bph_intro_01d">Locke, you&apos;re payin&apos; the fuckin&apos; laundry bill this month.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_05_to_arrival">Your ride will be there in about five minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_end_07">OK, I&apos;ll get right on fencing this. It won&apos;t be hard - this is the perfect kind of merchandise. Nice work!</string>
	 <string id="bru_run_03_02">The cops got roadblocks everywhere! It&apos;s like someone tipped them off! I&apos;ll pick you guys up a bit further ahead!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_33_01">Uhm... didn&apos;t we solve this already? </string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_17_any_01">They&apos;re coming from the south by the factory.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_intro_01_01">Here it is. The Golden Grin Casino.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_89_01">OK, you&apos;ve got all you need. Use the codex to solve the puzzle.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_05_08">Maaan, this guy just can&apos;t stop talking.  I&apos;ll kill him first.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_61_any_03">Got to go in ten!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_04_02">Second truck can&apos;t be too far from the first. Find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_20_03">Right, while we wait, and if you want to get ahead of things, you can get yourselves to the roof. Got a zip-line to set up there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_01_01">OK, you chops. Time to find that tunnel entrance. </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_42_02">That wasn&apos;t right. You need to try a different combination, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_61_any_04">Leaving in ten!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_48_01">All right, you&apos;re past the point of no return. ... Run! Run! Don&apos;t look back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_83_02">Reactivate the terminal. Let&apos;s get this finished.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_67_01">Cops shut of the power, go to the box in the street .</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_93_01">Look around the wine cellar for the fertilizer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_14">Every second counts, gang! Get to that coke while there&apos;s still some left!</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_18_09">You cooking pork chop sandwiches? Put out the fire. (quietly in the background) I&apos;m a computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_08_03">And there&apos;s the countdown. Now, find the alarm! Disable it before it kicks in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_33_02">Watch out, the bags are getting hot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_172_02">Get the winch hooked to BFD, gang.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_78_01">More screws to unscrew.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_g_01">It&apos;s supposed to be muriatic acid!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_15_02">You might be having a few more kerels coming soon, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_24">...I&apos;m 79% sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_100_02">They&apos;re flooding the vault with gas! It never goes smoothly, yeah? You&apos;ll have to wait until it&apos;s clear.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_29_04">You know what to do with that!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_15_02">Now wait for the cell to open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_100_01">Was that the cable?</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_11_any_04">It has to be there, the tiara is there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_10_01">Collect the ticket. Open the gate.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_07b_any_01">... be ready!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_11_04">You need to find the right storage unit!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_102_04">Hold your ground until the helicopter arrives!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_57_01">Oh. The best room in the safe house. The vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_118_03">I&apos;m going to need some time to do this, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_07_01">This floor should have an accessible door... if you use a saw, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_01_03">Hey fuckers, I got cops on my ass. I&apos;m hit. What the fuck was that back there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_ctb_02">There goes one of the bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_intro_01_04">We arrived in this piece of junk, but we&apos;re gonna leave in style.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_24_any_10">I&apos;m not 100% but I think it is hydrogen chloride now. Yep, should be.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_25_any_01">That&apos;s it, fine work. The escape is ready for you. Unless you want to stick around and clean out the vault. Either way the vehicle&apos;s waiting.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_24_01">And....ta-da!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_08_06">Got a lot of cops on my payroll. They&apos;ll fuck you, and I will walk out a hero.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_15_any_03">Cameras will set of the mines, guys! Stay away!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_05b_any_02">... just chill!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_62_01">Hang on just a little longer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_05_01">SWAT coming in! They were nearby. Wonder if they were already ready to hit him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_15_02">Did you check the boxes?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_24_any_02">Find the server room. From there we should be able to open the lab door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_07_02">This maniacs&apos; lair must be up ahead.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_02">I liked that guy. We&apos;ll send his wife a ham. Yeah, for sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_24_01">Pilot is on the scene with the lance. Go get it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_06_02">What are you waiting for? Get to the cell blocks!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_76_03">Bring him to the roof and put him on the chopper. I&apos;ll get him to sing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_cnc_01_01">The forest is dark and spooky tonight, gang. Let&apos;s cook a little meth.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_54_03">You need to find the computer and upload the GPS coordinates to the ship.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_11_03">No more quiet. Time to rock out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_116_03">The CFO thinks he&apos;s clever and that he can get away, but I see him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_intro_03_02">Explosives are placed. Gensec transports on approach. Almost there...</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_10_03">Damn! Alright, I&apos;m sending the drill. You&apos;ll have to open each vault til you find the turret.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_29_02">Heh, it&apos;s almost exactly the same as the other. Well, it&apos;s what we came for so take it and keep going.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_17_01">Good find. This keycard will get you into the railcars. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_10_02">Remember to go grab the thermal drill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_26_01">That&apos;s great. Now just hold on and wait for Bile.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_06_03">Excellent. Now if you would be so kind as to deposit the charges near the door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fourstores_stage1_end_a_03">Not a cop in sight. That was total control. I&apos;ll call Vlad now and tell him the good news.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_24_01">That codex! Those symbols... that&apos;s how we get the Mayan door to open, yeah? Look around for more clues!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_01_any_01">Get into the house and see if you can find Hector&apos;s cooks.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_02_02">You going to keep this up all day?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_49_03">It saddens me to see such beautiful hardware reduced to ruins, but it is a necessary evil. Now, our clean escape is assured!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_68_03">Get outside, friends! No standing about!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_80_03">Ok, I&apos;ve got it. Just need a little while.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_21_01">There&apos;s a computer by the reception. Use it to open me an access point so I can locate the patient.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_25_02">The inner complex is nothing to be scared of. </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_44_02">We want to get away cleanly so these must be destroyed. I can leave that to you, yes?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_cbf_01_01">Got a line on a recent drop of hard currency. It&apos;s tucked away in the vault of a branch of Roberts bank. It&apos;s a quiet area. Nothing happens here, so they won&apos;t be expecting a hit. Let&apos;s punish that complacency. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_20">...I&apos;m 93% sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_01_01">There&apos;s the dockyard, right ahead. Get inside. Watch the security though.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_04_02">Yeah, that&apos;s the one we&apos;re looking for.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_18">We&apos;re gonna fucking crash!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_81_02">You need to get some explosives onto the gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_45_02">Nice work! Now it&apos;s time to get out of there before the place falls over. Let&apos;s go!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_05">They&apos;re on us like fucking flies on a turd!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_25_03">Remember Charon, guys! Don&apos;t leave him behind!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_15_03">Tin Boy&apos;s got a snow-white soul! Hahaha!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_91_06">Get those arcane dingeses onto the helicopter!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_66_02">That&apos;s one, find the next!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_13_02">More snipers! Take &apos;em out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_52_03">Got our seven bucks back, gang. Stretch goals are good.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_05_any_02">Look for the office, guys - it&apos;s on the second floor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_06_02">You need to go to the West Wing, that&apos;s where the Oval Office is. Find the access point.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_36_any_01">Keep the civilians in check!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_end_loud_01">Nice work, friends. Those brandy-snifting poshies got what they deserved, yeah? Now let&apos;s see what we can do with that artifact. Duke will get to looking at it as soon as you get back to the safehouse. It&apos;s probably going to answer a lot of questions.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_27_03">Good thing you found that blueprint. That&apos;s the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_02_02">Get inside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_11_04">Blerrie! Go back and redo the hack.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_13_04">Garrett&apos;s office, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_18_03">Next, the vault door. It&apos;s accessed by two keycard terminals. Swipe them both ASAP. Got it? Now find two keycards.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_24_01">Nice! All right, great. </string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_end_02">That was very impressive. And you probably saved my life. I owe you one for this. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_16_02">Nothing I like seeing more than cheap foreign cars going up in smoke.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_33_02">That&apos;s good enough for the roof.</string>
	 <string id="plt_mad_03_02">The EMP is heavy and my fuel is limited. I need to drop it soon!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_24_04">Garrett&apos;s not going to be gone forever, so get to finding those boxes.</string>
	 <string id="plt_run_06_02">Too much heat around here. I&apos;m gonna have to fall back.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_101_02">The enemies fiddled with the drill. Fix it, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_06_03">Stay with whoever is carrying the server. It&apos;s heavy. Don&apos;t leave them behind!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_03_08">What&apos;s the delay, see a movie star or somethin&apos;?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_25_01">Guys, put a gas can on the paintings and shoot it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_88_02">When the coast is clear, throw up a flare to let Bile know!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_17_03">They ain&apos;t getting through this way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_85_02">OK, good. Now... wait a sec... guys... they&apos;re talking about sending in air support! You gotta hurry...!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_17_any_01">Get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_44_02">Wrong code, the alarm has gone off!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_01_02">Careful friends... get the drop on them, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_77_04">You need to hurry guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_04_02">Sounds a little unhinged. Best do it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_48_02">Now get in the bank!</string>
	 <string id="rb22_bph_intro_02a">Bain, old chum, here we come! Oh, such mighty poetry.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_02_01">Go inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_04_01">He&apos;s balding, wears a black suit. Most likely busy on his phone. Looks like he&apos;s ready to hand out pink slips.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_115_02">Moretta&apos;s at the berth. Time for a hostile boarding. The zip-line could speed things up.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_13_01c">Hurry up, Hurry up, I want to see that my merchandise is OK.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrasch_stage1_intro_a_02">Hit as many stores and glass interiors as you can. If you can snag cash and valuables, opportunistic, you understand. </string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_29_01">Ach, I can&apos;t get to the helipad. You gotta go and extend the walkway. Find the controls.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_33_02">I don&apos;t know much about fine art, but I know some poe will pay through the arse for that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_garage_03_any_01">OK look around - find the escape van!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_09a_03">Ok, have a breather while I fix this.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_100_01">Blerrie! They&apos;re flooding the vault with toxic gas! Wait until it clears!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_50_03">Alright he&apos;s gone again, so get back in his office, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_40_01b">I&apos;ve seen that before... is that... Romanov? The Russian empire?</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_04">Damn damn damn!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_15_any_02">Balcony - now!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_56b_any_05">... I&apos;ll come back in no-time!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_46_03">We know the Commissar called us from Georgetown. Look for something related to that place. Georgetown.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_25_any_01">Good, it&apos;s continuing. Keep an eye out, and keep defending...</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_02_01">Forget about the main entrance. Put on your mask and cut through that fence instead.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_31_03">Okay, the authorization worked. Get the scanner working now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_77_01">They interrupted the hacking! You&apos;ll need to restart it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_106_03">The code we got works on the armory. Get in there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_80_03">Time to blow the gates so you can take off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_04">Hell, Commissar just sent more coke straight down the pan. Hurry before it&apos;s all gone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_05_any_01">Make sure no one else is there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_24_any_01">Carry the coke down to the vault and plant it outside in the pre vault room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_06_any_01">He&apos;s coming in at dock 8, in front of the warehouse.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_50_02">Those stacked crates are due to be shipped out to the Commissar. Check the labels. Get the right one to the code reader, and that should lead us straight to the Commissar.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_40_01">Alright guys, get that door open! Let&apos;s see who&apos;s in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_06_01">The van had to leave. He&apos;ll be back soon at another location.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_51_05">Time to go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_76_02">He&apos;s lying, I&apos;ll take care of him myself. Bring him to the chopper on the roof!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_18_01">Next, we need to gain access to the main vault. It&apos;s controlled by two keycard terminals, and each needs activating within seconds of the other. So find two keycards.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_05">You move and it is Igor time for you, asshole.</string>
	 <string id="bkl_brn_intro_01b">I&apos;ll start by blowin&apos; off the head of this piece of shit mechanic, and after that we&apos;re gonna paint this room with your clown-blood as well. And the best part is that there&apos;s jack shit you can do about it. </string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_26_02">Yes, that is a giant piggy bank. No, I haven&apos;t lost my mind. </string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_04_03">The mechanic mentioned he saw them store engines inside the clubhouse. Go have a look.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_09_03">That&apos;s the alarm dealt with. Great. Don&apos;t worry about doors or windows now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_14_01">Those warheads are damned heavy. Use the forklifts to shift them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_14_02">You let the kerels fuck you. Fuck &apos;em back and fix the detonator.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_08_02">The van is coming back. Get ready!</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_05_02">Another of my packages! Find it. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_65_01">Thought it would take longer for them to react, but we got cops on the scene.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_05_01">Can&apos;t believe they managed to pull it off.  Never really thought Bain could be that vulnerable.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_15_01">Got it! Maybe I can get my job at Delta back.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_06_any_01">Alright, that&apos;s all I got room for.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_51_03">Kerels stopped the hacking routine. You gotta restart it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_04_02">I don&apos;t like the look of the prizes on that wheel, but I think we have to spin it anyway.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_70_01">I love this place. Cops don&apos;t swing by too often.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_13_01">Make sure you defend the circuit box that the security room is wired to. Keep the cops from interrupting!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_32_any_04">There&apos;s a lot of money in the shops, there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_44_03">We&apos;re going to bring the drill in with a blimp. For the pilot to see your signal, you need to set off a firework display. So look for them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_05_02">Now you&apos;ve got to enter the password.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_05">...unless I&apos;ve missed something...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_intro_01_02">Got memories of this place at 4am...</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_02_03">Keep in mind that there might be cleaning personnel and other non-kerels moving about.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_07_03">Bile&apos;s chopper should be here soon.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_46_02">The gate... you can pull it off with the winch chain if you attach it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_65_01">C&apos;mon friends, grab the donnerse and get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_69_03">The drill still isn&apos;t moving!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_23_03">The flare is burning nicely. Here I come. If I may crave another boon, would you mind attaching the pallet to the helicopter when I am in position? </string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_18_03b">All right, all right. I got what we needed. Take me back to the truck so I can finish this up.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_09_01">Hit it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_58_08">Hey, you wouldn&apos;t be interested in a little mercenary work, eh? No?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_26_02">Good, now you just got to kill the keypad.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_05_any_01">Alright, that&apos;s enough to go now if you want, but if we want more - get me access to the surveillance room so I can see what&apos;s on their network.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_40_02">There&apos;s a conveyor chute over there. It can carry the loot to the lobby.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_02_03">Yeah-yeah-yeah... Run the plan!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_12_03">Don&apos;t stop looking, you kaks. I tell you the pallet is there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_26_02">See if you can find something we can use to hack the vault system.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_10_any_01">Man... This place... Find that gold and we can buy one of our own.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_98_01">Nice, yeah. That torch is going to be useful later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_16_02">Our helicopter will be at the train yard any second. </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_06_01">Maybe in there?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_64_02">Hurry now, get that dwankie to the server room.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_05_02">Tell me if you are feeling sick. Or if hair fall out. Or balls fall off.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_33_02">Train is almost there. 30 seconds.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_96_01">Nice. Security chief&apos;s number. He won&apos;t be happy to lose this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_26_01">The hose has come loose. Reconnect it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_58_03">They just disabled your code. There might be another- a master code, but I&apos;ll have to find out who has it.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_01_02">Who.. wha... hey it&apos;s the Payday Gang!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_03_02">Have you located the security gate yet?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_53a_any_03">We can settle for this...</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_06">Another one. Good!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_12_03">We&apos;re good and going, I&apos;m hacking the system through the computer</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_19_02">Okay, listen. Twitch is waiting for you up ahead, just on the other side of the bridge. He&apos;s got a truck. Just drive straight up on into it, and this caper is closed.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_66_01">Found anything flammable yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_47_01">Boom! There&apos;s a garbage truck positioned to pick up the bags. Déjà vu, I know.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_08_to_departure">The escape vehicle is leaving in eight minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_09">They&apos;re wasting cocaine like Hollywood producers with fresh checks in there! Step on it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_36_04">We might be made, so let&apos;s hurry up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_09">Saw that one gun down a village in Uganda. Good man.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_65_05">You could be discovered any minute if you don&apos;t leave. Grab the box and make your way out, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_12_03">What do you know! A GENSEC armored cash transport! You could loot it if you want to take some cash home from this!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_94_03">They probably keep the car keys nearby.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_109_03">You gotta find a way in. Keep looking!</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_13_any_02">There we go. Get that thing to the van!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_77_03">If you missed any info, just use the button to play a pre-recorded message.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_01_04">Right!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_18_03">Look, my friends, if this is going to work, sometimes you have to do what I say. And I&apos;m saying find those fucking bundles!!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fourstores_stage1_end_a_02">Good work people. Sneaky, message received. The loot&apos;s gone, and Vlad will definitely be climbing the guys to fear list.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_12_01">One of Buluc&apos;s personal guards has the keycard for this door. From what I&apos;ve heard, they&apos;re not too bright, so they probably have to keep written track of who has it.</string>
	 <string id="plt_flt_05_03">I apologize, gentlemen. I accidently dropped the C4 on the balcony... Sorry.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_03w_02">Get ready for the third wave!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_95_01">Keep collecting things for Vlad!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_cbf_01">On the 22nd floor of the Garnet Group Building, owned by Nathan Garnet, there&apos;s a safe with millions worth of diamonds. The building has high-tech security and trigger-happy guards but luckily for us there&apos;s a birthday party going on to keep them distracted. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_03_any_02">We got company! The Mendozas&apos; probably here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_62_07">Would have thought all those weapons would have got you there faster, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_50_02">I tell you, Vlad will never like this hacking shit. Seems cowardly. When you want information or to get inside somewhere, you just need a good baseball bat.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_10_02">They cut the power to the network. You need to get it back on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_90_01">There&apos;s a lot of commotion in the area around the bank, you should clear it up for the van to be able to reach you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_06_01">Have you heard from Mr Pink?</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_19_02">Look like the chops are ready to talk, but we can squeeze them for more cash if you just keep going.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_24_any_01">What are you doing? Wait for me to mark them out. We need to cut the right wire.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_11_01">What are you waiting for, friends?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_06_04">His penthouse is on the top floor. My guess is he&apos;s headed there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_43_01">The cops killed the engine! Restart it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_14_03">Our rat is holed up tight. To get through the door, you&apos;re gonna need the code AND two keycards. Start looking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_94_01">Ok, now you need to aim the weapon at the second lock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_09_01">That&apos;s enough bags to make this worthwhile. Great work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_07_03">More snipers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_34_01">That&apos;s enough for the fifth floor. Good job.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_67_01">We&apos;ll hang all your completed masks right here. </string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_80_any_01">OK people, there&apos;s the bank, I don&apos;t know what&apos;s in there but it&apos;s gonna be good...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_12_03">Job&apos;s nearly done, guys. Just one more thing. Get the camera footage from the security room. I wanna make sure they didnt film anything we don&apos;t want them to.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_33_01">Ok the drill is up and running!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_66_01">There, now time to get inside the auctioneer&apos;s office to grab the code.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_68_02">Chop chop! This is going to be close!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_91_01">One down, two more to go. Find the other numbers and we get easy access to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_10_03">Old Locke&apos;s not gonna do it for you. Get in there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_39_01">The van&apos;s stuck up there! Plant the C4 on the bottom, blow it open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_81_01">All right, the code is...</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_36_03">There&apos;s the soft underbelly of the Investment vault. Get the cutter to work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_brf_01_01">Okay, Dallas. It&apos;s been two years since we worked together, and I need to see that you still got what it takes. We&apos;ll start with something simple, all right? An acquaintance of mine recently got robbed on a cocaine deal by some low-life mobster. I need to you to break into his night club and see if you can find the stolen cocaine and get it back. Easy, right?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_11_any_02">Nice work boys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_cnc_01">The cops are about to raid the Safe House. Grab your weapons!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_96_05">The cannon can&apos;t fire until you get fresh batteries.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_86_01">I had a contact hide a cooler in the elevator for us. Drop the vials in there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_40_any_01">Look, there&apos;s a girl in the window.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_31_01">There&apos;s gotta be more to this dump. The Dentist says the Commissar keeps his best loot in a fortified basement. I&apos;m sure you wanna know what&apos;s in there. Search the ground floor rooms. See if you can find anything suspicious.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_17_04">More corruption for the dwankies!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_08_03">These mercenaries must have some C4 or something around here that we could use.</string>
	 <string id="bkl_brn_intro_03b">You thought this was a rescue mission or what? Nah, it&apos;s not gonna play out like that. You fools are gonna witness me kill this piece of shit mechanic first, and then you&apos;re gonna join him in the afterlife. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_intro_01_02">To get to the Commissar, we have to find the Commissar. This motel is one of his operations. Cause as much damage as you can. If he calls, I can track him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_23_04">The armory shouldn&apos;t be too hard to find.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_75_02">There must be a door, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_25_01">Pick up that keycard, and get to his room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_end_01_03">Great job! These beauties will be tearing up the streets of Eastern Europe in no time.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_35_01">That&apos;s gonna be useful, for sure. Now get back and burn it open.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_02_01">Ahhh! The vault. I can almost (deep breath) smell the magic!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_58_any_02">I got to leave in two minutes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_30_03">We&apos;re almost finished. Get to the escape, come on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_02_01">Great. That&apos;s keycard one. We need to find one more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_07_03">Okay, let&apos;s move it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_40_01">Great. Now get that gas on those tires</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_37_01">...screw the bolts into the floor, yeah.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_72_03">No more need to be quiet! You got trouble coming!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_109_01">Maybe tear down every last book from the shelves until something turns up?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_48_01">The stones in cases are top priority, but grab whatever else you can.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_47_03">Second keycard can&apos;t be far. Gotta be nearby. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_39_01">Okay, now just walk out of there. Carefully...</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_11_01">What are you waiting for? Run back to the helicopter and secure the loot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_80_01">Put your mask on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_pep">Keep it together! You can&apos;t fall apart now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_73_02">This is a new tactic. I&apos;m seeing cops placing tripmines in the parking lot. Don&apos;t let them get that shit set up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_19_03">Don&apos;t let the neighbors see you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_35_any_01">Great, that&apos;s the server room, start the computer in there, we need to upload all the files.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_20_01">Umm... ok, destroy stuff. Got it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_20_03">Crew, I&apos;m guessing that that construction yard across the way is your best bet for getting out. They have a truck. Sending you some C4 to bring the wall down now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_22_02">Keep going uphill after you reach the overpass.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_10_03">Three down, just one to go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_42_01">The insider sure delivered. Now keep an eye on the drill - it&apos;ll surely jam every once in a while.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_14_02">Not sure it was the server.... could have been something else.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_89_03">Casino manager has the first briefcase. The Pit Boss has the second. And then the head of security. Need all three for the code.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_08_any_01">Alright, that&apos;s four. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_25_02">OK, we&apos;re pumping! Let it fill the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_59_02">Go to the corridor outside the server room!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_04_any_05">I can only take two at a time...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_02_02">Time to get in character, the others are waiting for you.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_29_02">Wrong key!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_03_02">Don&apos;t let the cops focus on the truck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_50_any_03">Bain&apos;s got a little plan - I think all those media choppers are a convenient smokescreen for our escape chopper, don&apos;t you?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_80_01">You&apos;re looking for something that can take an armored door down!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_53a_any_04">You can play it safe and call this a day...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_04_02">The missing server is probably lying on the desk of some IT monkey. Get down there and find it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_03_02">The thermite I gave you will let you get past the mansion walls, and inside.</string>
	 <string id="bru_run_04_01">Alright, I&apos;ll be there soon!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_34_01">Locate Buluc&apos;s office. It might be upstairs.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_62_02">Hurry up you chops, get into that tunnel.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_16_03">He hid the coke with a VR headset. Find it, it should be in the electronics store.</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_01_01">There he is! Shake that useless sack of shit awake. Davay, blyad! Why is my plane on fire? </string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_01_any_01">Cut that fence and get down to the hangars. The Mendozas are in there.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_54b_any_02">... you sure are some thorough sons of bitches!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_06_06b">What the hell! Come back here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_08_05">Take that bastard out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_01_02">First, you need to break into the depot. Try and keep it quiet. If you can&apos;t keep it quiet, make it fast.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_park_escape_location_02">The van will be coming in near the park.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_03_03">Once you have something to break them open, get searching the crates.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_51_03">What&apos;s the delay! Get going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_11_03">The cops are here to check things out. Take &apos;em out quietly, and we can still finish this without raising southern hell. </string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_44_03">We&apos;re going to need to fund some upgrades soon, so feel free to grab more loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_intro_02">Come on guys. The Butcher wants this guy dead, but don&apos;t forget, the house is full of riches too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_03_01">You heard him. The trucks are around here somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_34_01">Your Crime.net is updated. There is a heavy duty drug cartel head in town. His name his Hector Moralez. Look him up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_17_03">I&apos;m sure the Commissar doesn&apos;t have fire and damage insurance on this dump. So go nuts. Trash the rooms, scorch the cars - anything you can do to rile that guy and get him on the line.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_53_02">You need to set up fake sentry guns.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_46_01">OK, this is getting too hot. The van is leaving. I&apos;ll get you a chopper. Stay cool.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_41_02">This whole enterprise will be for nothing if you dont get that time lock tick-tocking again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_01_02">There&apos;s goes the alarm. And our camera feeds with it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_103_03">You have to open up that ark-dinges.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_03_01">You need to find the shipping crates to get to the machines.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_27_02">There&apos;s probably a laptop at the contruction site.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_100_03">There&apos;s The Dentist&apos;s whatever. Haul it out of there and we are done with him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_06_02">Don&apos;t forget the goat in that apartment block. </string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_09_to_departure">The escape vehicle is leaving in nine minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_93_03">Well, that&apos;s that. He got a look at me, so I had to... let him go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_04_03">Ok, that&apos;s the laptop. Good job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_79_05">Think the Commissar got this thing from Vlad. Slow Russian junk...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_05_any_01">Get into the house and see if you can find Hector&apos;s cooks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_11_any_02">Everyone listen up, the pick-up&apos;s here now. You&apos;re going to need to cross over the walkway, he&apos;s on that side.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_02_02">Great. Now search the docks. You&apos;re looking for something that tells you which truck has the voting machines and is headed for Washington. Search containers, computers - anything. When you&apos;ve figured it out, tag the right truck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_13_02">Well, that takes care of Chavez. Pick up the key and get back to the panic room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_07_02">Don&apos;t hang around, crew. Everyone - into the boat!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_05_01">The storage room guys. Get in there and get the car keys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_18_03">Moretta is in position. Get on deck and look for the explosives. Move!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_32_02">Get the keys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_54_03">Out of there guys, via the platform.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_140_01">Nice, now old Locke&apos;s coming in hot, so be ready!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_08_07">I confess I was a little worried there. Thank you.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_32_01">There we go. Adios amigos, fucking cops!$NL;</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_28_04">C&apos;mon guys, find that safe.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_10_01">Don&apos;t fuck up. Hit it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_95_03">Keep those civvies stable, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_29_01">Wait, what? The lead scientist is dead? Well, the only way we&apos;re getting past that door is with the help of his hand...I guess you&apos;re gonna have to do some dirty work...</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_12_03">Find the circuit box, crew. You need to hack it to halt the fan.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_09_03">We&apos;re inside. Good. Next, gonna need a couple of keycards. Smart money would be on them being indoors.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_08_03">Telling the pilot to return with the C4 to bust you through there. Just hang in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_56_02">Grab some sapphires if you have time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_12_03">Drills incoming!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_cro_02_01">That&apos;s one hell of a shooter! He got &apos;em good! Now, let&apos;s do our part. Let&apos;s get our loot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_03_any_02">OK, power&apos;s down. No more shocks. I hope.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_22_04">You have to keep them away from the hostage.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_67_01">Cops aren&apos;t going to let us walk out with the bank&apos;s bail-out money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_20_01">Ok, release the balloon!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_60_01">There, all done! Enter the vault and let&apos;s get those pardons.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_37_01">That&apos;s a good amount of bling. But if you want to grab some more, you can.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_03_04">You need to get inside the police station.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_20_01">You gotta find that plane. </string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_25_01">Time to end this caper! Get to the escape. Follow the blue containers!</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_15_02">Hmm, gonna need my car key.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_06_03">The metal detectors need to be shut down. You can do that by disabling the power. Look for circuit boxes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_42_02">Use a glass-cutter. Don&apos;t break the glass!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_38_any_02">The broken window gave you away!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_12_05">Any luck with the evidence room?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_18_01">We were told there was something important about a shrine. Have a look.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_20_01">Go find the PC in the Glitter Room, but don&apos;t stop to dance.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_03_01">Wrong wagon. Crap! Keep looking!</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_04_any_01">One minute till the van leaves.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_34a_04">Those chains will have to come off somehow.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_44_02">Get the bags to the platform.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_18_03">Can&apos;t get the code without the keycard.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_30_03">The box, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_18_03">Damn, the mercenaries got to the EMP and stopped the charging.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_03_01">Oh, that voice is familiar. Just hope he doesn&apos;t crash.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_35_03">You&apos;ve got to wait here for the pickup.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_14_01b">All right, I&apos;m gonna need two things: a gas tank and some exhaust pipes. Go into the workshop and find a ceiling lift. That&apos;s where they store them. Get it down and bring both to me.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_24_01">You gotta find those codes. Search through some laptops.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_58_02">Maybe have a look upstairs.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_30_02">There&apos;s the alarm. No problem. Plan B. Put on a show, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_73_02">All&apos;s still quiet. Keep it that way. Now board the ship.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_10_01">Aw fuck, they shot Brown in the face!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_43_03">It&apos;s not going to go off if the kerels interrupt it, so keep them away!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_03_03">There can only be one shitfaced Santa guarded by cops in this mall. I hope.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_09_02">Why is no-one getting the C4? Makes no sense to Vlad. </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_67_05">They turned off the electricity, get the juice flowing again, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_03_02">So he&apos;s a car freak. Well... soon he will be a dead car freak.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_25_02">To get that tree out, you need to blow the glass roof off the mall. Just light a flare and then wait for Bile, he&apos;ll be bringing in some C4.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_03_03">The shells are tucked away. Nice work, I&apos;m sending your getaway.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_end_b_03">That worked like a charm. Well fought and well carried out if you know what I mean. Payday is coming our way, well deserved.</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_11_03">Sawing again? Great.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_10_01">No code. Try another one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_135_03">There they are, just like Bain said. Take them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_12_04">Maybe the buildings are your best chance for finding keycards.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_01_02">Ah, this almost feels like a real war! Did I ever tell you about the time I did a covert mission in the Middle East? Anyway, before we land I gotta tell you some things. You will need to find a security keycard to get into the PEOC. No way we can drill or blow our way into that place. I reckon the best place to start looking will be near the Oval Office!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_88_03">That manifest you picked up will point us to the right containers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_22_03">Don&apos;t shoot down the big helicopter that&apos;s coming in for the money, okay? That&apos;s me. Yeah, for sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_34_03">Run a bypass in the control box!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_23_01">Wow, that was one hell of an explosion! Cops are on their way now, so drive fast!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_15_01">Good, now just hang back a bit.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_30_any_03">Hook me up again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_04_02">That&apos;s used bank notes from our &apos;allies&apos; overseas. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_24_01">Got it! Downtown!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_cnc_05_01">The underpass is a vulnerable spot for the convoy. Hit it hard.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_05_06">The ground is full of bodies of those that dare take me on. You will join them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_58_01">The containers are ready for you. Get searching.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_16_03">The drill has been delivered. Find it and get it to those vaults.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_88_03">Get those restraints off the prisoner!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_01_02">What a house! You can tell the Sosas are making money. Let&apos;s hit this place - quiet or loud, the Butcher doesn&apos;t care how as long as you kill the guy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_37_01">Maybe you gotta take down all the books, friends?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_121_03">Amazing! Just climb up onto BFD and we call it a job done. Or stay behind and really pick the place clean.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_17_03">Go take a look at the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_08_02">All right, I made the deal. Un-cuff the hostage so we can get our teammate back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_08_01">Use those offices as your advantage!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_31_any_02">Got connection. Keep working.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_13_01">Still waiting on that network hook up guys.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_03_03">Three minutes. Cyclists! I&apos;ll cut your throat!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_19_02">The feds&apos;ll do everything they can to stop you from leaving. Get out of there - hurry!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_03b">Oh, just the secrets of the universe and the means to end humanity.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_138_02">Blerrie! The Murkys have AA weapons outside the White House. You gotta take them offline so I can land.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_45_03">Good job, now get that open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_30_05">Take the box and go, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_37_any_01">OK, chopper&apos;s coming in, get the prototype ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_garage_01_any_01">That was one hell of a crash. The cops aren&apos;t gonna give you a break though, so get on your feet!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_50_01">The old days were more fun. All you needed was a gun, an axe and maybe a nice drill for kneecaps. Vlad will never understand this hacking shit.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_15_02">OK, you&apos;re out. The gas will clear up - just hang on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_107_03">.. or stay, if you&apos;re feeling greedy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fourstores_stage1_end_b_03">A bit OVERKILL but I guess all is fair in love and war. Mostly war, on Vlad&apos;s part. </string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_23_any_02">Smack daddy in the middle. Alex dropped good.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_110_03">Good time for ziplines, maybe.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_06_01">Good job on not raising the alarm. Keep it up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_03_03">The crates, gentlemen? With the strobes?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_28_03">Wait for him to pass then you can move.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_09_03">Don&apos;t be afraid of the C4. It won&apos;t explode. Well, not yet. Vlad is funny..</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_22_any_01">Great, that&apos;s it. Now you can open the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_01c">Man, if we get out of this one, I never want to see the inside of another office building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_11_any_01">Well done guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_85_01">The code should have a four at the beginning.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_91_03">Some good old-fashioned explosives should open up the entryway in the wall behind that shrine, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_86_04">Go find something to cut those chains!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_01_any_03">OK, there&apos;s a boat on the way to pick up the bags, people. Go secure them first for the transport.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_77a_02">You&apos;ve got to restart the hacking asap!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_38_any_01">Throw in the engine!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_81_01">You need to secure all the loot with the zipline.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_33_01">Damn! Red lights across the board. Forget the keycards, the time lock and the softly-softly crap. It&apos;s plan B time.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_03_06">Jumpin&apos; fuckin&apos; Jesus guys, I&apos;m gonna get creamed.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_82_01">Get the equipment bags!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_39_03">You gotta find something we can make it go boom with. C4 would be ideal, many cartels use it. Add some mulching fertilizer and diesel fuel, then you have a nice mixture.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_10_01">That C4? Pretend it is poor lost baby. Love it, nurture it....then put it on wall and blow it up! Yes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_49_02">They would probably want easy access to the tunnel, so check around outside.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_01_02">Hey, this is Hilary at Gensec. Is Barney there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_19_01">You need to ignite a flare to signal the helicopter again.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_62_any_06">Alright, I&apos;m going!</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_04_11">Sounds good to me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fourstores_stage1_intro_a_03">Vlad wants us to hit the four stores for cash and other knicknacks. Show him how we roll fast and clean. Easy in and out. </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_23">Don&apos;t feel bad. He was a bad man, for sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_91_05">You need to find the garage!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_18_01">There&apos;s no way you&apos;re hauling those out on your backs. Hold on, I&apos;m going to find you a transport.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_19_08">They must think we&apos;re a bunch of chops with an offer like that. I think we should make them give us more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_42_01">Now get that winch put together in the main hall.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_11_01">Okay, Taxman goes for the server - I think...</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb2_02_03">Streets are calling with cops, but I got us a sweet ride. Just get down here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_93_04">Still having trouble with the gas?</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_30_01">Now decorate the tree with these fine things!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_26_02">Alright, now you just gotta wait for Bile to arrive. I hope he won&apos;t be long.</string>
	 <string id="sys_hb2_12_01">Exporting encryption keys to external drive. Please stand by.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_39_08">Now turn on the water!</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_11_03">Alright, looks like some witness testimonies were missing. Going to have to hit the hard copies. Get to the Archives and grab &apos;em.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_22_01">Guys, you need to get those pieces to the pick-up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_22_03">Ah crap, cops stopped turning the bridge. It needs to be restarted. One of you, get on that!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_11_01">The crash site is just after the underpass - Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_48_any_03">Dead civilians bring the heat, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_10_02">That&apos;s the wall gone. Looks like a few voting machines ate it too. Now move!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_88_02">Lasers in front of the vault. Let&apos;s shut them down.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_02_03">Oh, no fuckin&apos; way are we gettin&apos; out of this one lads.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_58_01">Place the missiles next to the radar and activate them. Easy peasy. </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_13_01">C&apos;mon gang, you gotta get to the lab, find the right shelf.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_end_b_03">Don&apos;t you just love science? Great team effort. We&apos;ve retired the engine until... Well until we decide to liberate it ourselves. Enjoy the payday.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_05_03">You gotta wonder how many people have snuck as far into the White House as you guys, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_23_01">Good. Hose is OK. Let&apos;s get that pressure back. Start the pump.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_22_02">There you go friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_10_02">They&apos;re sending in Minigun Dozers too!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_17_01">What are you doing? Follow Bain!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_36_02">I&apos;ve seen that equipment pull a two-ton Roadwarrior out of a bog in ten seconds, but that hatch is holding tight. </string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_14_03">Time to open the red door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_17_02">You got nothing? You guys are killing me!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_05_03">You need to get that Jewelry box!</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_08_01">Here we go, this should do it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_gold_brf_speak_02">The Harvest &amp; Trustee bank just got a big gold shipment from South Africa. I think we should make it go away. I can&apos;t see they&apos;ll miss them much.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_04_02">Just a minute. I have to open the gate!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_end_a_01">That was a superb display of stealth. You guys are made of shadows. The machines are hacked, the votes are flooding in and it is a landslide for The Elephant&apos;s man. God bless democracy!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_14_03">Now get those bags in the containers down on the floor. We&apos;ll return and collect them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_16_04">The West Wing. It&apos;s in the west. You know.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_brief_01b">I&apos;m betting it&apos;s in their safe.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_52_03">You&apos;ll probably find explosives around there to use.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_19_06">An offer is on the table, but it&apos;s hardly even enough to bribe our dear Mayor! Press them for more, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_33_02">See anything with historical significance?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_78_01">Make sure you protect the hacking device while it works!</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_08_04">Fucks sake. Assholes! Fucked it. Shape up, or I&apos;m pullin&apos; you out. By the short and curlies.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_44_02">Aweh! That&apos;s it! Oh, sorry friends... got a bit carried away. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_112_02">Don&apos;t forget the fireworks. Vegas will go up like 1999.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_25_07">Make sure Charon gets to the van!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_85_03">The saw has stopped cutting! Blerrie federales!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_23_03">OK, there&apos;s the C4. Help yourself!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_14_02">Hope you didn&apos;t get too toasty. Great job.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_54_01">Get to the platform.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_05_01">There it goes. The vault is open. It&apos;s all yours, gang. </string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_15_03">Perfect friends! Get into the vault room now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_36_03">The escape driver is coming in by boat to pick you up. Make sure you are over by the small water access near the river.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_30_01">Don&apos;t let it keep ringing, someone&apos;s gonna get suspicious!</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_01_05">I heard you guys up in the booth were good. Don&apos;t let me down, y&apos;hear?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_17_01">Alright! Now get the bag to the cage. Once we have it filled, our guy will fly over and pick it up. Just like James.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_35_03">Point of no return - this place is getting hot! Get out!</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_06_04">You&apos;re right where you&apos;re supposed to be, Duke.</string>
	 <string id="bru_run_01_01">I&apos;m almost there, get ready!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_02_07">Okay, now comes...</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_50_03">Ah, that&apos;s a tunnel entrance if I&apos;ve ever seen one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_42_07">Come on, gang - get the water pumping again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_14_any_02">Keep it going in there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_59_06">Vaults take just a moment to open. A security measure. Security is important, you know.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_56_04">Now look for the evidence storage. It should be on the second floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_can_02_03">Get the elves working on the product. Just holler at them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_intro_01">Alright... Infiltrate, extract the target and destroy the evidence. Good luck, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_88_01">Drill, friends! Drill some more.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_28_02">The stick should be compatible with any laptop around there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_162_04">Our All You Can Eat buffet is now open, and I wanted to make sure that you knew.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_31_02">There you go, that&apos;s the keycard we need!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_76_02">Friends, do you guys ever feel the walls closing in when you&apos;re going down in an elevator? </string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_14_03">He&apos;s almost there. Watch where he drops the bags. Grab them, assemble the cage, and send up the balloon. You&apos;re going to like this.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_56_01">Blerrie! Murkywater operatives are trying to block off the area, keep away from them, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_03_01">Dogs! Dogs! All of you, pig asshole dog fuckers! I&apos;ll find you. I&apos;ll skin you alive.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_40_01">There you go. If there&apos;s nothing else you want to take, get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_11_03">The manager&apos;s office is your next stop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_06_01">One more!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_47_02">If you need more equipment, go back and check the stash outside, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_02_any_01">Get into the house.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_03_to_arrival">ETA is three minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_84_any_01">OK, great. Now get that thing to the vault door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_06_02">Snipers! Take &apos;em out, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_47_03">That&apos;s it? The briefcase? Perfect! Now we can get outta here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_end_01">Well done, friends. We got what we came for, but that last... we need to figure out our next move. After you left the warehouse, Murkywater comms went completely dark, off the grid. We hurt the Kataru good, but we don&apos;t know how they will retaliate, and Bain would want us to keep going, no matter what happened to him. Duke is going to have his hands full figuring out the next piece of this puzzle and what those boxes are actually good for. Until then, we lay low... plan... and survive.  </string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_51_03">Now do the other one.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_14_03">That&apos;s as much as we can do here. I saved all the intel on this server. Grab it and let&apos;s get out and see if we can make sense of this. </string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_21_any_02">OK people, I&apos;ve got an alternate escape chopper coming. He&apos;ll be here soon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_can_03_01">Keep the cops dropping, and the elves hopping, gang!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_12_03">Mr. Blonde&apos;s boss will be able to sell those stones quicker than me, so get the bag to him, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="plt_mad_02_02">I dropped some C4 in a rush, look around for them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_16_any_05">Guys the tiara is probably in a safe or on display somewhere...</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_22_03">There&apos;s something electronic and glowing in the Admin Office.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_12_02">The terminals. You see &apos;em? You need to check them for the code.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_31_02">You need to find the code to the vault. Maybe there&apos;s something around there that can help. The workstations perhaps? Have a look around but stay quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_17_03">Crap. You guys seeing this? Something went up there. Pyro team - fix it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_60_07">I&apos;m going for a drink. Let me know when you&apos;ve got the box, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_67_02">I can&apos;t come and get you if you don&apos;t hurry, friends! They&apos;ve got F35s flying CAP around the White House! </string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_52_02">Keep your eyes on the roofs! Got a bad feeling creeping up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_31_01">Blerrie paw-paw! The courier forgot the winch! Ok friends, I&apos;ll have one coming by train shortly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_06_01">It landed on sniper again. Get ready guys</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_intro_01_01">OK, pull over here, and get your masks on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_116_02">I just saw the CFO through a camera feed, he&apos;s still there, neaby.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_36_03">Do it, shoot the wires!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_23_any_02">I&apos;m at dock nine. Hurry up, will you?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_39_01">Perfect, now get back to the car and get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_62_02">Not long now, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_121_02">Something happened, I lost the connection. Power problem. Get me running again, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_15_03">Drill is done. Time for the Commissar to be done, too. </string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_104_02">Hurry up and take the keycard, then make your way back.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_27_02">There we go. Deceptively simple, yeah? You can get past the electronic lock by cutting the right wires in the cable boxes there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_110_02">Get that C4 planted in the Gambling Hall, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_05_03">This vault&apos;s got an Achilles Heel. It&apos;s temperature controlled. Jam the vent fans at the back with crowbars. The temperature rises and the failsafe opens the door. Easy. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_87_02">Almost got it... Almost got it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_04a_04">Come on friends, you have to open those doors.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_29_03">You know the deal, grab the loot or escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_105_02">Just one more and you&apos;re done!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_22_03">Yeah, I&apos;m reading sniper teams on the rooftops. Watch yourself.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_44_01">Keep searching.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_33_01">Maybe there&apos;s a utility closet or something nearby with a toolbox you can use. Go have a look.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_cnc_04_01">It&apos;s a beautiful day for a picnic at the park. And an armed robbery. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_08_03">The manager&apos;s hair is thinning. That might narrow your search.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_11_01">Hey! These terminals likely have the comm frequency for the Moretta. We&apos;re gonna need it before long.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_02_any_01">OK, no time to waste. The cops are right behind you, get the bags secured.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_31_01">Almost there, gang. Just some more on the roof and we&apos;re good.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_27_01">Better hang back until the gas is gone unless you really want to risk it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_13_01">You got that crazy bastard. Now, get the key from him and return to the panic room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_79_01">Get ready for the vault. I&apos;ll have the code for you soon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_32_02">Time&apos;s almost up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_05_any_01">30 seconds till the van leaves.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_06_01">The hell he have in mind?</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_13_04">This Mr. Blonde doesn&apos;t appear too keen on getting those stones himself.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_51_02">I got it! Oh, wait... No, you said time lock code? For the vault? One second...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_26_01">Come on, crew. Get in there, grab that loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_07_01">Not sure exactly how many cameras there are.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_69_02">Another civvie on the scene. Make sure they don&apos;t call the cops.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_23_01b">Jesus fucking Christ... That was too close.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_36_02">What the? Ah fuuu... Containers were locked when the alarm tripped. Drill them!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_31_01">Have another look around. Maybe Garrett has the code written down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_22_05">Will you hurry up! All this coke going to waste, it&apos;s breaking my heart!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_50_01">Those crates are headed out to the Commissar&apos;s other dirty dens. Get those labels and check them at that code reader.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_05_02">Damn, that guy is blocking the stairs. There&apos;s only one way to do things now.</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_01_02">Merrrrrrrry Christmas!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_26_02">Look outside the Tiffany Room. I can see a laptop display in the security feed.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_04_02">Diesel tank and hose somewhere around dock.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_02_01">Are you still trying to find a way in?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_76_03">You can hack the door! Get to it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_09_01">Great. Alright. Next step is to find two keycards. Most likely indoors.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_02_03">Our C4 has been stashed in supply closets marked with a red X. Find them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_20_02">Use the print to open the safe.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_20_05">Answer the Intercom!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_12_19">I had a feeling that was the wrong ingredient...</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_end_loud_03">Vlad&apos;s brother-in-law is back safe and sound, mostly! I suppose we showed those dwankie kerels that you don&apos;t mess with Ukrainian gangster-types, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_80_03">Swipe Ralph&apos;s keycard, then punch in the code.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_03_02">Three minutes...fucking Prius drivers!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_26_05">If you don&apos;t bring one, you have to find one. A tool, that is.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_74_04">You must find that lever and pull it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_35_01">Good, now let&apos;s go. Can&apos;t carry him much longer!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_154_01">What was that room again?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_19_02">The helicopters are flying away. It&apos;s working.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_78_02">Heli is almost there, have that guy ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_park_marksmen_building_01">Watch out, they are deploying SWATs inside a nearby building.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_29_05">Don&apos;t want to get stuck in there with Garrett, so make sure you don&apos;t lose him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_79_03">Hurry up and look through the rooms!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_intro_03">Ok friends, you&apos;re going to like this! A little smash and grab in the dead of winter, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_05_05">Let&apos;s try a katspoegie of hydrogen chloride.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_12_any_03">Look around for the switch. It&apos;s got to be there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_48_01">No. Uh, just give me a second...</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_75_03">See if there&apos;s a door around there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_99_01">The stones in cases are top priority, but grab whatever else you can.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_28_02">There might be more loot on the yacht, but you got what you came for. Your choice.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_16_03">You guys need to go back to pyro school. What a bunch of horse crap!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_45_01">I wonder why those are on the side.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_22_02">Kerels got to the crane, you need to get it going again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_08_02">I bet you there are some explosives laying around here. See if you can find any.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_39_03">Now that&apos;s a beautiful hole right there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_103_03">Get Vlad&apos;s jewelry to the garbage truck!</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_03_03">Yeah-yeah-yeah... Run the plan!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_80_02">We still need to get that ship to the berth. Ummm... OK, I got it. Hack the ship control terminal. Keep the cops off it.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_11_any_01">Almost there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_03_02">That box there controls the gate. A few snips, a bit of rewiring... and open sesame!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_18_02">Keep the feds off that footage, guys. We&apos;re nearly done here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_02_02">Goddamn kerels are helping Murky! Garrett must have gone deep with these bastards after our little visit.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_14_01">Ropes still connected.</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_cnc_02">A pilot of mine has gone down in the woods. Find him, get him back here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_24_01">... we can forget about drilling our way through this. It would cause too much noise. Maybe we can find a way to hack it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_25_03">Outstanding. We&apos;re almost done - now get to the escape. Just stay with the blue containers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_26_02">Find the vent, and start pumping the gas. We&apos;ll make their security center fuzzy and warm and... *yawns*</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_87_01">Now get our friend out of those restraints!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_37_any_01">Five to go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_19_08">We need two keycards to open the vault. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_intro_02_01">Blerrie! Ghaaa, you Russian mendicant!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_18_01">Great! That&apos;s one of the closets!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_73_03">They&apos;ve got the vault secured to the last bolt.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_17_any_02">Dammit does anyone have an ECM jammer - that&apos;s about the only thing that&apos;ll crack that door. Othewise you need another route.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_22_02">I have an idea how we can get the code. Head to the telephone pole connected to the house. Time to make a call.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_51_03">Next, find a way into the vault area.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_01_02">If we wanna get Hoxton back, we gotta follow the Dentist&apos;s plan. Step one: bust up the motel.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_74_03">There you go, now you need to get into the actual mansion.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_42_03">Let the drill get through that gate lock. Protect it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_29_01">Good, now get to the vault!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_53_02">Can I remind you that this chopper is grounded until it is refueled?</string>
	 <string id="crn_man_00_01">I&apos;m on it, lifting in ten.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_79_02">The plane is full, you can take off the hose.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_cps_01b">Listen - I have a request. We need a cleanup operation - some officers ran into unexpected resistance on a routine raid. There were no survivors.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_37_any_01">Damnit! Gas! Gas!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_05e">I wonder if this is where they keep Amelia Earhart&apos;s plane...</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_36_01">Maybe the code has to do with Crimenet?</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_01_02">Where the fuck are you guys? How the hell did they know we were comin&apos;? I&apos;m comin&apos; to the warehouse... got capped.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_59_03">No need to sneak around any longer. New plan incoming.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_17_02">Guys! You got one minute!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_05_03">Find a laptop and plug the USB in. It should be nearby.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_42_01">Guys, you can&apos;t have searched the whole train yard. You must be missing something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_51_02">The thermite&apos;s done - about time! Now enter the vault!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_49_05">No time to relax yet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_23_02">Throw the loot into the tree!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_78_01">Place the C4 on the gate!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_86_03">You gotta get that thing out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_99_01">C&apos;mon guys, lets change the change!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_37_02">I put a few replacement bits for the drill in the piggy bank. Fetch &apos;em.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_31_01">Go go go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_24">...I&apos;m 79% sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_22_01">We&apos;re not going to get in there without the code. You&apos;ll have to find one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_cnc_01_01">This one is a hit on one of the high-class auto joints in town. The Teuer car dealership.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_20_03">You got a blowtorch, don&apos;t you? Use it on that gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_06_02">That&apos;s them. Now scan them in, and fax me a copy. I&apos;ll figure out the right vent.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_end_01">Once again, my friends, you have done me a good service. With Buluc now being shit out by fishes, I think the Coyopas are finished. And the Dentist has no more help in Mexico, so he will be desperate and vulnerable. Whatever job you have coming next should be easier for you. Just don&apos;t forget about Vlad, yes? There are a lot of things happening, things that could be dangerous for us in the future. But we will talk more... soon. Cheers and goodbye.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_11_02">Can&apos;t stand around all day. Get to it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_27_03">All right! Streetlight is history. Grab the goat!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_27_03">There you go. Now, plug it into a computer.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_66_any_03">I&apos;ll get that one! Go get another!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_99_02">You need to bypass that laser system.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_02_02">The vault has two security routers protecting it and you need to shut them both down. Easily done if you patch me into them directly. Look for them mounted on the walls. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_brf_01_01">Keep the civs down, look out for cameras. Scout the place and find the best way to do it without raising the alarm.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_38_03">You took everything they have! Time to ride off into the sunset, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_81_03">There&apos;s a control terminal for the ship around there. Hack it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_51_01">There you go, now find the other one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_14_03">We need to get eight bags with us for this one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_30_02">Another grate, so just treat it like you did before. Burn through with the thermal paste.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_26_02">Don&apos;t forget the drill, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_intro_02">Cover your ears now....</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_04_any_01">OK, that&apos;s it! Now get that thing open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_dj_01_01">I paid the DJ to play some crappy songs he found online, so you&apos;ll risk less civilians getting in the line of fire. </string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_83_02">One</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_24_02">All right! Bridge is back! Now, into the car and get the hell out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_16_01">There&apos;s a ladder leading to the roof. Over the garage.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_14_02">The goat is deadly! Kill the electricity first!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_03_06">We&apos;ll go with muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="csk_cs1_01_03">Hi, I&apos;m trying to reach Reilly-Needazheet. First initial &quot;I&quot;.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_11">...this is not my forte.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_21_02">These frequencies will be useful later on. For now, though, stay focused on the job.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_73_01">Kerels have cut power to the office. You gotta get it back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_12_any_03">People, get those bags into the truck. We need at least four bags.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_129_02">I&apos;m about to open the vault for you. Stand by.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_13_03">Light the flare, gang. Pilot is blind without it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_31_01">Don&apos;t forget to plunder that vault. Haul the loot to the chopper. Always nice to make a little extra money, gentlemen.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_42_01">Cameras. Everybody hates cameras. I set up a room with a couple variations for you to test your stealth. No shame in failure and also no one shooting at you, which is nice.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_22_01">Now, the keypanel outside the vault! Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_17_03">The chopper is headed for the antenna. Stand by!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_22_01">Damn, they really saved their big guns for last. And it looks like she had a keycard.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_30_02">OK, time to get in that vault, chop chop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_12">They&apos;re flushing that coke down like their lives depended on it! Hurry up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_38_02">Just two minutes!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_80_04">Look for something that can breach a heavy door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_40_03">Damn, they got the power for the scanner!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_24_02">There&apos;s the chopper! Bile, lower the hose. Gang, get ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_11_01">According to the Dentist, the Russian&apos;s shift a fair bit of meth out of this flea pit. Probably have a home brew operation up in one of those rooms. Smashing that up would really piss off the Commissar.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_06_02">Piles of green! Thats why we&apos;re in this business, gang. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_124_02">Zero!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_42_01">Good afternoon. My name is Randolph, and I&apos;ll be helping you today.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_40_01">You need to set up the drill at the gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_12_01">You&apos;re inside, but the alarm is counting down. Override the lockdown so we can get back on track!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_62_06">Why are you not at the weapons lab, yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_38_01">Ok, you&apos;ve cleared the place out! Time to get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_49_01">Try another one. See if you get it right this time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_intro_a_03">Don&apos;t give the cops a damn thing. Just signal Hectors guys with the floodlights in the warehouse and get that coke onto the speedboat. Nothing fancy here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_05_03">There you go. Now see if you can find the cell blocks.</string>
	 <string id="bkl_brn_intro_02">I don&apos;t know what made Rust stab us in the back, but I really don&apos;t give a shit, as I never cared for that silver-haired fucker. But you are a couple of fucking fools for coming here, you hear me? </string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_34_03">Tree is leaving - get Santa aboard!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_05_01">Good job, now get the bags to the van so we can get the hell out of here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_26_01">I&apos;ve got him. Let&apos;s get out of this bekakin&apos; place.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_09_03">Then we can go ahead and get you guys access to the back office, where the vault is.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_70_02">Guys, I think the cops just shape charged another entrance!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_60_01">Nothing in here. Keep looking!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_16_any_01">Bring as much cash as you can to the van!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_29_01">The glamorous life of a heister, huh? Find the exit.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_01_02">Get searching the wagons. You can expect a fast response from the cops. Remember, you&apos;re looking for the wagon with the vault!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_54_01">Restart the winch. And keep the damn cops off it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_05_any_01">Yep, that&apos;s the inventors address. Beautiful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_d1_02">It&apos;s hydrogen chloride.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_86_02">There should be tools lying around here somewhere!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_05_01">The storage room is blocked off with sturdy metal doors, yeah? If you find and tap me into the security boxes, I can unlock them from here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_29_01">Answer the phone and put me through.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_09_02">There you go. The vault with Vlad&apos;s merchandise is behind a security gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_32_03">Now, an eyeball with a pulse is needed for the scanner. Look out for the FBI boss. Make sure he keeps his pulse.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_12_any_02">Cops coming up on your west side. Construction site.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_75_01">The CFO has the master code guys. Find him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_39_02">Keep it quiet, gang.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_69_03">The right computer has to be around there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_18_02">Take a look in the Jade Room for one of the PCs.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_37_01">Alright, Bile dropped the lance! Grab it so we can keep this show going.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_32_01">Stand by. Hold your ground. The pilot will drop those bags any second.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_133_02">Nine!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_07_02">That&apos;s... two. Two guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_54_01">Living on borrowed time, as it were.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_d1_03">Chloride. Hydrogen chloride.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_04_01">Hook me up. I should be able to get into their system from here. </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_67_03">Alright, now find the control panel to charge the weapon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_151_01">Where are those blueprints, gang? Scan &apos;em, send &apos;em. You can do it in IT.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_73_01">If you&apos;re feeling ready, go ahead and leave the facility.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_77_03">We go to our backup plan. Have a look around and see if you match anything to those wire boxes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_13_03">You still have to stop the code from changing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_26_any_02">Ah,what!? Guys, you have to be careful with that stuff, I told you!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_23_02">The White House aids in the current administration aren&apos;t known for their tight grasp of security. Wouldn&apos;t be surprised if we could find something on one of their laptops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_42_05">Let&apos;s get that water flowing again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_32_03">10 seconds on the clock!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_20_03">That&apos;s bag one. Keep bagging, gang.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_106_01">Time to prepare the next component.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_20_02">And there is the final closet.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_94_03">Right, now hurry and collect all of Vlad&apos;s &quot;precious&quot; loot and take it outside, chop chop!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_06_01">This is gold. It&apos;s got all the locations of the hidden cash.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_16_03">Gangways must be removed and ship defended.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_03_02">What&apos;s takin&apos; so long, Goddamnit?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_97_01">Now, power up the weapon again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_10_03">Every second counts friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_15_any_07">Get in there folks, bag that cash.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_17_02">Protect the EMP! The mercenaries will do anything to stop you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_25_02">Into the shelter! Move it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_89_02">No way to get you more supplies from the chopper. You&apos;ll have to make do with whatever you find around there, so look around while I&apos;ll try to get you past.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap03_03">You must come for coffee some time. See my new pets!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_18_01">Search the Jade Room, I saw a glowing monitor there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_end_b_01">Excellent work. With these paintings in place in the senator&apos;s apartment, we&apos;ll have plenty of coverage. Like a Trojan Horse, but lots of them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_44_01">Grab the box, friends.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_55_any_05">I&apos;m going to raise suspicion here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_38_03">One, two, buckle my shoe. Yes, it would seem all of the bags are present. Now, please, attach your good selves to the cables and join me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_17_any_01">Holy shit! They&apos;ve boobytrapped the doors!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_12_any_02">Those guns are gone! Keep that fire burning.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_05_01">Damn, that cheap piece of shitty Russian crap scrambler crashed. Get it going again.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_08_12">Look at all this fucked up concrete. The fires. The screaming. If anything, I like the place more! Haha!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_40_01">Get on those terminals, gang. We need the comm frequency.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_48_01">Don&apos;t forget - stow that loot up into one of the vents.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_13_any_01">That&apos;s one bag!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_01_any_01">This is the boat. I see the lights, I&apos;m on my way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_76_02">That&apos;s the alarm. Screw the keycards - we&apos;re blowing the gate. Bile is close by. Drop a signal flare, and he&apos;ll drop the C4.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_13_03">Kiff, now you just gotta make that hole bigger to get into the vault room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_13_any_01">The van will be there in about a minute.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_03_03">That&apos;s it. Now wait for the pilot to signal in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_03_01">Looks like a good entry point will be the teller door. Use a saw.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_90_01">Guys, the briefcases. Check the owners office. Then find the pit boss. And, lastly, check near the guards&apos; locker room.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_10_any_02">Throw the bags into the barrels!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_89_01">Light a flare when you&apos;re ready to leave.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_74_02">But old Locke has a nice little dinges coming for you. Go out and clear the square!</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_cbf_01">Hector&apos;s death left a vacuum in the powder trade. Nature abhors a vacuum. Fucking abhors it! There&apos;s muck-fuckers crawling in from everywhere. Bunch of Hondurans are trying to spread. Let&apos;s hit them before they can take root. Break up their smuggling ring. Steal their product. What can go wrong?</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_01x_03">Hey fellas. This is...uh, Night Wing One. Gimme just...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_49_02">Very strange, this. One of the boxes is in the bio-lab? That&apos;s where you go next then, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_01_any_02">OK folks, we&apos;re going in and looking for the vault. Cartel or not - it&apos;s still a bank, right?</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_03_03">Hurry man, my ass is gonna be grass like if the cops had lawn-mowers!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_18_02">I miss the old Soviet shoes. Not so many stupid models to choose from!</string>
	 <string id="vld_dn1_01_01">Payday crew. Vlad. There&apos;s a marked pig in that warehouse. It&apos;s very important to me. It&apos;s for... er... present for mamma. Yes, that&apos;s it. Don&apos;t let the Feds get it. Grab it for me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_119_02">We will make actioning that our top priority. Thank you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_11_01">Now listen: The police will have the entire site surrounded any minute. The clock is ticking! Take the canal route, quick!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_32_any_01">It&apos;s done! Open the labdoor!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_47_01">There&apos;s a juicy bonus waiting for us if you crack that second vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_tap02_01">What are you doing, you chop?</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cr3_03_02">That&apos;s all I got. I&apos;m outta here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_19_03">The canteen, friends. Get there now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_122_01">Roberts Bank.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_73_03">Get to West Wing. We need to get you into the Oval Office.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_27_02">Blerrie, that&apos;s the vault from the blueprints. </string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_10_05">Get the tag to the computer so we can code it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_114_02">It must be where they keep the pardons we are after.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_22_03">You sure? Better duck down and make sure it&apos;s ok.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_12_03">If you have cards, you can close the barriers. That oughta hold &apos;em off Hoxton for a while. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_01b">I&apos;m impressed Hoxton isn&apos;t having a nervous breakdown coming back to this place.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_34_02">Great, now Mr Blonde brought some liquid nitrogen to help crack that door. Mr Blonde?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_100_01">That&apos;s it... whatever it is! All right, the drop off is a storage room. Take that there and secure it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_16_any_02">OK, people! One more bag - we just need one more bag to satisfy Hector. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_08_01">OK, here come the bluechip hired henchmen.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_45_01">Check between the trains too, guys. Don&apos;t get sloppy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_15_02">Have a look in the trucks for materials.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_94_01">You&apos;ll need to find the car keys. They should be nearby.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_21_01">Blerrie, they know something is up and are scanning the building for trespassers!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_98_03">You&apos;ll be needing that torch later for sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_30_03">You cut off his hand? That&apos;s some dark stuff, but a job is a job. Place it on the scanner and get the door opened.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_06_07b">What the hell are you doin&apos;? Don&apos;t leave me!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_29_03">No worse than being locked in a van with Wolf&apos;s ass on semi-automatic. Find the exit.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_05_02">Only way to get the doors open is by hacking the panel. Find it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_97_03">You need to leave, you chops, before all the kerels in Mexico come down on you!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_102_01">Now grab as much of Vlad&apos;s merchandise as you can carry and get it out to the garbage truck!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_11_03">The wheel has stopped. It says drills. I got no clue.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_73_02">Get to the wine cellar, chop chop!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_14_any_01">Expect cops any second now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_05_03">I got those scramblers from Vlad. (mimicking Vlad) Very best Russian tech. That lying fuck.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_52_01">There. Now just give me a minute.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_57_02">You gotta protect it for a bit. Shouldn&apos;t take too long.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_18_03">He&apos;s heading for the canteen, you gotta follow him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_random_stage1_intro_a_01">OK, this is the bank. I advise casing the place, then grab the thermal drill from the back parking lot somewhere. Hit the vault however you want. There&apos;s usually a security room so be cautious. </string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_05_02">Ach, and they&apos;re sending in Cuff Cloakers now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_05_03">Find the security panel so we can get that door open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_17_03">Don&apos;t let the swats interrupt that timer!</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_06_01">The fuck happened back there? No way the cops knew we were there that fast.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_01_03">Those stairs should take you to Buluc&apos;s wine celllar. You can enter the mansion through there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_23_01">If it were me, I might hide something important in a lamp or something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_48_01">Ok gang, let&apos;s give Mr Blonde some help with a distraction. Lure away the cops by getting out through the bazaar by the Jack Rabbit Slim&apos;s.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_06_any_08">No! I can&apos;t take any more, not now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_34_03">Could be linked to his wife... a date or something?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_31_02">You found the exit, but it&apos;s not ready yet. You need to go back and secure the cash.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_14_06">CD interest rate, 50%! But no code. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_intro_01b">Get to the roof with the gadgets and bang, we&apos;re gold - literally. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_36_03">The code might be connected to us and Crimenet, in some way?</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_03_02">That computer station should have a laptop laying around. See if you can find one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_108_02">That&apos;s one card entered, but the vault needs two. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_12_02">Sure, I got it but what good&apos;s it gonna do now?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_01d">Maybe we&apos;ll find out what happened to Jimmy Hoffa.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_75_03">Haha, you guys give new meaning to going loud.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_04_01">Ok, I&apos;m flying this sucker out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_02_03">Let&apos;s go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_61_05">Take care of that food yet?</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_06">We got a fucking police caravan on our ass!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_80_02">There we go, I&apos;m connected. Just... a... feeeeew....</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_38_any_02">Load it in!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_05_03">Just get these bollards out of my way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_01_03">Ok guys. Let&apos;s go in. Quiet or loud, you can kill this guy any way you want.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_04_any_03">I can only take four at a time...</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_02_02">Something&apos;s fishy here - I think there might be snipers in those windows.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_01_02">An old fashioned break in. Stay out of sight.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_53a_any_02">That&apos;s enough...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_61_01">Get to the weapons lab. It connects to a storage room where they&apos;re keeping one of the boxes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_34_01">There&apos;s the coke. Outstanding, guys! Bag as much as you can.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_29_02">Damn! They killed the lead scientist? I don&apos;t know, guys. We still need his hand for authorization...Do what you have to do...</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_03_01">Holy shit, what&apos;s going on outside? Oh, it&apos;s hot in here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_08_any_01">Alright, the process is on, it&apos;s cooking. I have a contact with a specialist through Hector. I will guide you guys through it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_25_03">That&apos;s why the government doesn&apos;t work, friends. A bunch of domkops. Look around for that USB stick, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_81_any_01">Nice, seems the surprise loot was cash. Bag it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_47_02">Remember, you gotta find that mic recorder.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_11_03">Well, logic would suggest he keeps the thing in his office, for sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_04_10">Soda. Caustic soda. I don&apos;t think you&apos;re supposed to drink it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_97_03">You need to charge the gun again to fire.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_26_03">OK, that&apos;s done. We got a pretty good payment this time but we could probably have held out longer.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_04_02">Slice those trucks open, my friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_03_01">The server with the results should be around here somewhere. Find it and make those votes unusable. </string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_05_02">That&apos;s one box down, one to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_105_01">OK, Bile is on the roof. Get to him ASAP.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_27_02">The control will be found overlooking the complex.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_06_any_01">Looks like Hector&apos;s cooks are dead. We have to make the meth ourselves!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_35_02">Okay, that&apos;s the digits for the armory code. Enter it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_30_02">You got in and out without making a sound. Good job, Dallas. I mean it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_27_02">It&apos;s in position. Let it go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_19_03">You&apos;ll need to remove those barrels, and you need to do it fast. Just release the straps or something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_06_01">Secure all of the loot at the ceiling vent in the closet marked by the Inside Man.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_01_any_03">Phone&apos;s ringing, time to pick it up and start this trade off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_02_03">Gang, you need to take care of those anti-air guns ASAP. Find a way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_38_01">Now plant the C4 in the main hall. The vault is right below. Two possible spots to blow. Hope lady luck is with us!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_21_03">Don&apos;t get caught up, get to the coke! They&apos;re not fooling around! Oh, my poor heart...</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_61_06">You&apos;ve got to get Garrett out of there again. Find some food.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_09_03">Don&apos;t hesitate - just jump!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_15_01">Cameras are now disabled.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_16_02">Guys! We&apos;re done here. Grab your wheels and burn rubber!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_26_05">You guys sure take an awfully long time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_44_03">Jimmy will love it if we get all the data we can, really sticking it to Akan.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_64_01">Keep moving - get down to the garage!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_60_02">Well, fuck and shit. Cops shut down the vault&apos;s opening. Get it going again, and kill any fucking kerel that goes near it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_31_03">Sorry, gang. You need to get more cash before leaving. Hold your breath and head back.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_41_01">Listen you fucking poes. You&apos;re only getting on the roof from the store room ladder, and you&apos;re only getting in that with the keycard. Look for it!</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_01_01">Three minutes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_88_03">When you&apos;re ready to leave, light up a flare and Bile will come get you.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_07_02">I have a pleasant little farm outside the city. Boris will lead you there. He can remove those packets of coke. </string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_55_07">Quit messing around and get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_51_03">OK, the Moretta is free to move but we gotta convince the Captain. Find the comm frequencies. I&apos;m betting one of the computers there has it. I&apos;ll convince the good Captain to fire up the engines.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_75_03">Blocked and fortified. You can&apos;t blast your way in, but have a look at that R-FID box.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_07a_any_04">Only 30 seconds left...</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_22_any_02">People, dock eight!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_intro_01">Ok team, lets get a move on. The Butcher means business here... remember, you&apos;ve got to kill Ernesto Sosa, and steal the loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_06_01">I count twelve cameras to deal with.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_35_03">Time to leave, friends! Get into the chopper.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_35_02">Don&apos;t forget any parts of that winch, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_65_03">We need some lighting fluid for this braai !</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_104_03">Better haul ass, gang. They&apos;re putting everything they have in to this assault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_29_01">Great. Now you can mask up again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_02_01">There could still be office personnel working, so keep your eyes open, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_102_01">You need to prepare the next ingredient.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_cafe_02_to_departure_01">Step it up, you&apos;ve got two minutes to get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_06">Oh, that wasn&apos;t the right ingredient after all.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_71_01">What are you waiting for?</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_20_01">All right, clowns - keep your eyes on the road.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_28_any_01">Alright, vault is popped, but watch out for those lasers, they connect directly to the alarm</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_24_01">When you have enough bags, let the balloon go, and stand back.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_04_06">They seek him here, they seek him there, they seek him every-fucking-where!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_24_any_03">The lab we are after should open by hacking their server. Find the server room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_41_04">Stop dossing, time to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_12_02">Saddam had his enemies heads served on that platter.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_05_10">I&apos;m still hoping there&apos;s going to be a spaceship buried down there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_58_03">Time to use some of Joy&apos;s new hacking routines.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_15_02">Look for alternative ways inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_06_01">All right, you need to get into that slaughterhouse. There&apos;s C4 stashed nearby. That should make a way in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_18_02">Ok, that&apos;s the server room door opened.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_55_02">Get him talking people. We got root and just need the locks undone.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_23_03">Maybe have a look in some computers around there. See if anyone has been careless with their security clearance.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58f_03">It feels like a shame to do it, but Buluc has a couple nice cars in his garage. Rig up one of them to take down the turret.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_intro_a_02b">Hector needs footage to show the world and, well, for our own safety.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_107_04">The cooler guys, don&apos;t leave what we came for!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_61_03">The emp will give us a way in but it&apos;s primary function is to take care of the test subjects for us. If the stories are true, we don&apos;t want to take these guys on.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_01_06">Please go outside and smoke, you can&apos;t smoke in here sir... Bunch of crap!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_14_02">And another one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_104_03">Quickly now, get the crane moving.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_109_03">That gate is not opening without a big drill hole in it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_14_02">We are going to need to find a way inside the lumber mill. Maybe we can blow a hole through the wall using the AA gun we hacked?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_83_03">Open the boxes. Our client demands one bag, but your professional honor demands you take as much as you can.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_04_01">Caustic soda. Yes, that&apos;s it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_28_01">OK, friends. Time to leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_66_04">Get to the circuit breaker and get the power back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_87_02">Put two vials in the cooler so you can leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_42_02">Great. Now, please, keep the cops away from the time lock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_67_03">Cops cut the power. Get on the street and turn it back on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_14_01">Right friends, looks like you&apos;re not welcome there any longer. Twitch is inbound. He&apos;ll be there soon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_48_03">Get the server, without it everything fails!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_09_any_02">Now we wait. Remember we get a bag of cash for every painting we throw into the chopper. All we need to do is be patient and lucky. </string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_07a_any_03">30 seconds now...</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_05_01">Enter the store and grab a hostage so we can trade back our friend from the cops.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_46_01">Kiff! Now go and have a look inside, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_22_05">The hostage is in danger.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_04_02">You&apos;re breaking up... Can you hear me ok?</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_cnc_03">Gotta hurry, guys. The Continental just called, you&apos;re going to New York on a rescue mission.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_23_03">Excellent, Alex, knew you were the right man for the job. </string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_05_04b">Why did I offer to fix the bike...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_36_01">Bile is on his way with the thermal lance. Won&apos;t be long!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_113_02">Oh man, the vault is already open. Thank you, Mr Manager, for being so accommodating.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_47_03">Go and pour out the thermite.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_60_02">Chopper on the scene, but it ain&apos;t the feds!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_14_04">Any luck yet?</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_02_01">Those are the thugs running this little toyshop. They&apos;ve been naughty boys. Drop &apos;em, and get inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_32_02">Last chance to secure any loot in the tree!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_34_02">Maybe something to do with his wife... an anniversary or something?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_39_02">Now move into that airlock. The PEOC should be beyond it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_10_01">Crack that safe, probably something good in it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_44_02">Holy!.....they crashed right through Wilson&apos;s wall!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_22_02">Plan B is en route, though. C4 can do the job loudly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_37_any_02">OK, chopper is here - get the engine loaded up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_43_01">Our escape chopper is out here, but you will also see a lot of radar equipment. With this, they could follow us anywhere we could fly to. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_97_03">Hope there&apos;s something worthwhile in here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_can_03_02">Don&apos;t let the cops interfere with the elves, crew!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_63_any_01">They&apos;re shooting at me!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_31_01">That is the first of some fucking sweet loot! Excellent! Now, you will find a large vertical shaft nearby. Send loot up it by cable. I will look after it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_64_03">Put it on the floor and burn it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_12_02">Balloon is up. Are you seeing it?</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap04_02a">Hello my friend.</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_11_02">Keep the cops away so it doesn&apos;t stop cutting.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_32_02">Good. Now, plant the rest on the fourth and the fifth floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_114_02">Looks like one of her coolant tanks is finished. Be gents and fetch that girl a refill. Uh, from the crapper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_01_any_02">OK guys, we&apos;ve got another job from Vlad. We&apos;re gonna rob a nightclub.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_39_02">Now this qualifies as a score. Clean it out, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_15_01">We&apos;re in a train yard, there should be tools laying around somewhere. See what you can find. A blowtorch would be perfect.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_120_01">Get up to the roof and light a flare to signal pickup.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_23_02">OK, hose looks secure. Now let&apos;s get that pump pumping again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_69_02">That&apos;s the last camera in the vault area. Good job.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_80_03">The mainframe will hold the location of the second box too, so get back in there, friends.</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_10_03">Aaaaand...that&apos;s the last elf gone. Sad, but they served their purpose. And we got what we need. Time to leave, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_22">That kak woulda sold his mother for a dollar.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_03_07">Hey Duke, is this what you thought you&apos;d be doing a year ago?</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_31_02">Center button!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_01_02">I don&apos;t know who you are. But I will find out. You fuck with me, and you find you fuck with the wrong Russian, friend.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_56_01">We are finally almost finished! Please, join me at the helicopter!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_07_08">More snipers? These guys mean business!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_03_03">Guys, get the parachutes, quickly! Don&apos;t get too far from the money!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_intro_02">19... 20... 21... All that money and Garnet is too cheap to pay for a faster window washing rig! Ok that&apos;s it, 22nd floor and... go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_intro_02a">Friends, you&apos;re right on time. The auction hasn&apos;t started yet and the guests are still mingling about. Our item should be in a vault in the storage area at the back of the mansion.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_37_02">See any numbers connected to us?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_04_03">Spin it, let&apos;s see what happens.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_02_02">Truck&apos;s moving. Stay with it!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_03_any_01">Great!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_75_04">Time to go home, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_49_03">Who has the second thermite can? More thermite means a hotter burn. Basic chemistry. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_12_any_01">That&apos;s it, the alarm&apos;s off. Now get that door open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_13_05">Acessing now...</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_12_01">Gang, get into the construction yard! Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_08_01">Damn, that&apos;s an original Gustoff!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_27_02">Vault needs a three digit code, and each digit is held by a manager. They hold them in computer briefcases. Gang, find that code.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_17_05">Ah, just imagine putting a slug right in the middle of old Garrett&apos;s gob. But not tonight, friends. Long game and all that, yeah? </string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_08_any_02">The chopper will be there any minute.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_84_01">Reactivate the computer, gang.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58d_02">It&apos;s going to get real heavy if you stay around too long. Get moving!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_105_02">I think they&apos;ll do a bit more, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_38_01">Every year around christmas I get a little nostalgic you know. Old times, old enemies.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_70_02">That&apos;s all the cameras dealt with. The whole bank is blind to us now. Great!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_16_01">Move gangways and defend ship from attackers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_25_01">Our pilot&apos;s deploying the lance. And by deploying I mean kicking out of the window.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_30_02">Gang, lead him to the scanner. Make him use it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_08_03">Make like that little mouse in those old cartoons and get moving past the lobby. </string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_04_02">Patch me in. I can do some mischief from here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_16_03">All right, the cops are inside. Quiet takedowns! </string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_04_01">Thats the wrong direction! Or is it? Go East. Always East.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_06_02">That&apos;s it for the time locks. Just get through that last door!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_41_02">Good, now combine all the components and arm that firecracker. </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_intro_02">After this, how about we go to that place Sangres is always talking about for some fish tacos and a show. Twister-something-something it was called...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_42_03">Second control room. Controls the gate here. Other one is over the way, see?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_42_02">Alright you chops, that&apos;s enough for Vlad. Get out of there when you feel ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_38_03">There&apos;s a second can of thermite there. Someone grab it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_20_03">Blerrie, turn the place upside down if you gotta. Just find it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_12_03">Really, Bile? Gang, the EMP ended up inside the lumber mill instead of outside.Need to get in there now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_23_02">Keep moving into the prison.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_28_any_02">Loot, loot loot. Nice find. I think this belongs to us.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_123_02">The code is...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_24_03">Great. Keep going.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_40_02">I&apos;m starting to understand why it&apos;s so important, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_40_01">Now just hold tight and wait for Bile to drop the winch.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_20_02">Now you just gotta make sure no one gets away and alerts the guards in the ICU.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_04_01">Keycard, arc cutter and, yes, those are breaching charges. We need to make it look like I am not involved. Collect them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_22_any_08">It needs hydrogen chloride, for sure... OK wait, soda... Yeah, caustic soda!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_17_01">There it goes. Remember, this isn&apos;t a speed boat. Going to take a while. Keep a low profile. Be careful not to trigger the alarm. Or search for extra loot. Your choice, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_03_03">Go forward and don&apos;t stop!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_84_01">Nicely done! The gate should be open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_12_01">Nice! That&apos;s the money you sent ahead. OVERKILL thanks you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_16_03">Make sure he follows you!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_86_01">Try and find some tools in a storage room or something!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_24_03">The Murky&apos;s nest egg is cash money, so start looking. It could be anywhere around there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_40_03">Keep searching for components.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_46_03">Go down to the basement door in the back alley!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_58_02">Argh this damn lobby, you gotta get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_tap01_01a">Yeah OK, OK give me a minute yeah? I&apos;ll set it up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_35_02">Wait for Bile to come back and pick you up along with the loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_15_02">There&apos;s one of the closets. Get picking that lock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_17_any_01">Alright, get in there and find the tiara.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_101_02">Those guns will make smelly swiss cheese out of Bile&apos;s chopper. Take them out by hacking the control boxes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_52_01">You&apos;ll wanna answer the pager before too long.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_30_01">Attach the wire to the tree!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_08_01">Chopper&apos;s headed out, but stay cool - it&apos;ll be back. Look for more loot in the forest. And stay safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_20_02">Twitch is on his way with the van. One minute.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_39_01">Find that saw! It has to be around here somewhere. Try looking around timber logs.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap06_03">Vlad? Is that you, you piece of shit?</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_89_any_01">Good thinking, boards will slow them down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_67_01">There are centrifuges all around there. Use them to start validating blood samples.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_56_01">Great, hihi. He had it coming!</string>
	 <string id="sys_hb2_05_01">Good afternoon, Director Stevens.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_54a_any_04">You got all of them? Woo!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_25_any_01">You&apos;re inside? Good job.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_deposit_cnc_06">Who doesn&apos;t love a secret, am I right? We&apos;ve got a bank vault full of &apos;em to look into.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_87_02">Look for a code that starts with six.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_31_any_15">19 bags!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_04_01">Bastards! Bitches! Fucking... Asshats! I will kill you for this!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_44_02">Get me hooked up again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_11_03">There&apos;s a few body bags stashed nearby.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_01_01">Right, you chops. Let&apos;s get you ambling into the bank.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_03_02">Stop admiring the sights and find those trucks!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_end_b_02b">Let&apos;s just fix this bank and burn the Mendoza money ASAP. We can find you new identities after.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_08_02">Friends, there&apos;s no going through that door, yeah? Get up to the second floor using the scaffolding outside. See if there&apos;s a weak area in the floor or something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_16_03">Great. Now head to the Insider. She&apos;ll be able to open the gates.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_43_03">Our escape by helicopter is imminent, but we must cover ourselves. Beyond the door Murkywater has an impressive array of radar equipment.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_02_02">Two minutes. Get off the road, old cunt!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_05_01">Come on you chops, keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_24_03">Make space for the escape van - get those police cars out of the way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_23_05">They haven&apos;t spotted you yet. Still good.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_13_any_01">See if you can find a way to destroy the weapons or bring them to the van.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_61_02">I&apos;ve got your escape vehicle coming, but those kerels will give you some hell in the meantime.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_14_01">Maybe we can get past that scanner if you used a piece of tape to lift the manager&apos;s fingerprints off something?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_86_02">Get back to the control box and shut it down.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_13_01">They are all over the main entrance. We can&apos;t get out that way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_15_02">You still need to get that key, and that means finding Chavez.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_49_02">Who the - damn cops messed with the hack. Restart it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_55_02">Now hook up the detonator, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_03_03">Looks like this gate requires a keycard. Find one guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_12_03">We need the gate code, crew. Get searching those terminals.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_18_02">Alright, she&apos;s berthed! Get up on deck and start searching the containers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_23_any_04">Tick tock, guys! Cops are on the way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_14_any_02">Use your code - defuse the C4!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_08_01">OK, the first machine is hacked. Keep going.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_91_03">Come on guys, get to the roof so Bile can pick you up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_19_any_02">You guys are so close. Don&apos;t get sloppy now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_22_any_09">I&apos;m 100% it is some caustic soda needed here. Drop some in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_62_04">Quickly now, to the weapons lab!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_10_03">There, now get out and crack that thing open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_37_02">Gang. Get that cutter onto the vault floor. Let&apos;s slice that thing open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_02_any_03">Hey, we don&apos;t have much time! I&apos;ve got a boat on the way we&apos;re going to use as a pick-up. Just hustle ahead of those cops and get the bags secured. </string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_02_02">Be there in a few minutes. Stand by.</string>
	 <string id="bru_run_02_02">Ah! I&apos;m shot! They got me, I&apos;m shot!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_76_03">How&apos;s the refueling going?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58i_03">Get that SWAT van out of the way if it blocks you.</string>
	 <string id="elp_framing_brf_outro_01">Best of luck, gentlemen.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_44_03">Good job, clowns. Keep the wheels burning.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_11_03">Throw more tablets in the mixer if you want to keep cooking, crew. Or light the flare and bail. Up to you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_13_03">Mount the drill on the safe in the truck. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_intro_04_02">OK, guys, here they come. Get that crane moving!</string>
	 <string id="loc_run_03_01">Get to Jake&apos;s parking and I&apos;ll get you out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_25_03">You need to go recode the key tag.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_17_01">Alright. The panic room door is controlled with a code and a special key. Just find that code and key. Simple!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_100_01">Bag those stones and get them to the garden. Get them out with ziplines.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_09_any_07">Yesterday, people!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_08_02">That disabled the metal detectors. Good job.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_14_01">That&apos;s him! Get him to the top of the tower!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_30_03">Let the drill do it&apos;s job. We&apos;ll have the Commissar soon enough.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_43_03">You need to get the bags back to the window-washing rig.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_intro_01c">Hahaha that was kiff! Now get going, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_07">Ha! I bet he didn&apos;t expect that, for sure!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_77a_04">Come on, restart the hacking!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_13_01">Find the prisoner first and then you can worry about the cash.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_37_03">Damn, that was the wrong tile! </string>
	 <string id="pln_run_21_03">Go on forward guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_78_02">Protect the hacking device!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_18">...and hope it works.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_21_06">What&apos;s happening with those drills?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_56b_any_06">... I&apos;m back in a little while!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_22_03">Just a minute for the helicopter.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_09_01">Nothing happened? Must be the wrong one. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_78_02">You&apos;ll stand a good chance if some guys provide cover, while others work on those boxes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_37_02">What? That must&apos;ve been the wrong tile!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_06_03">All right, the truck is through there. Grab the C4 from the bin and blow that door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_64_02">Your first priority is finding your ride out of there. Maybe check the hangars, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_89_01">Seven</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_14_01">You&apos;ll find the code inside the auctioneer&apos;s office but to get in, you gotta get the keycard from him.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_10">God damn!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_26_02">That&apos;s Buluc! Take him out. No need to dally.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_57_03">Make your way outside and go down into the sewers. You&apos;ll need a bit of thermite to cut through the grating, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_22_any_02">OK, OK! Plan B - find the server room. Shit!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_44_any_08">Another twelve and we&apos;re done!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_44_02c">That dwankie?</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_08_03">You should find a pass phrase there. You&apos;ll need it when you call him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_47_any_01">In case you don&apos;t have time to drill, use a shape charge if you have one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_103_01">You have to press those symbols in the right order.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_08_03">Putting those radars out of action is our next job, gang. Do it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_21_01">The bank shutters can be closed from the security office. They should help you keep the police at bay!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_10_any_01">Looks like keys to an airplane or something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_01_02">There should be a fence nearby. Cut it open and get inside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_54_01">Use the one owned by &quot;Chloe&quot;.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_58_02">These coppers ain&apos;t worth a yak&apos;s baff.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_07_03">Be a good little criminal, and press that fucking button!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_84_02">You cutting though yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_14_01">Ok, gang. We need to find a way into the lumber mill. This might be crazy, but maybe we could use the anti-air gun we hacked earlier? Just redirect its position and blow the wall up?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_124_01">Zero.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_84_02">Another power loss!  Switch it back on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_77_03">You gotta keep the pump running. Protect it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_66_03">You&apos;re keeping it quiet. Great. Remember - you need the keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_08_01">Alright! That&apos;s the whole database. I should be able to sift this data, maybe find where the right truck&apos;s headed. Your work is done guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_31_02">Wouldn&apos;t be surprised if Garrett has the code around there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_21_02">Ach! They&apos;ve started searching the building!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_25_02">Great, now start up those drills.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_08_to_arrival">The escape will be there in eight minutes.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_01_11">Ah, fuck you guys. We&apos;re doin&apos; this shit.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_18_any_02">I think those tunnels will get you into the warehouse folks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_13_any_02">Alarm is off. Smooth. Open the door!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_13_01">You gotta get that blocker placed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_24_02">Don&apos;t let any civilians get near the alarms!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_133_01">They just activated several gun turrets. Stay frosty!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_11_02">You opened the last truck. Check inside!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_86_03">Make sure those domkop police don&apos;t get near the drill!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_44_any_01">Our chopper is coming in, he&apos;ll blend in with all the news choppers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_cbf_01_03">A jewelry store downtown has just stocked up with jewelery. That jewelery could be ours. You up for it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_41_01">Grab those parts, heisters.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_109_01">Get out of that burning steel coffin, gang!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_52_02">Right, now let me just get this sorted. Won&apos;t be a jiffy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_c2_04">...caustic soda?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_52_01">Ok, the security gate needs to be opened.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_26_01a">This reminds me of an op I did many years ago, when I was still a laatie, jippoing ABC 80 computers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_25_01">Get rid of the cops!</string>
	 <string id="loc_run_03_03">I have an extraction plan. Go to the parking lot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_43_01">Great! Plane on approach now..</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_04_03">Got it! I always liked to play with cars as a kid...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_34_02">That bag&apos;s holding a heavy cable. Use it to connect the hatch to the pick-up. Start it up and let&apos;s crack open that basement.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_05_01">Look for the security panel, gang. That&apos;s the only way in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_34_03">Time to bounce, gang!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_08">...that&apos;s my best guess.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_82_02">You gotta set up the drill!</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_03_02">Boris is on his way. Isn&apos;t that right, Boris?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_07_02">We need more water! Chopper&apos;s going to fill her tank. Hold the vault!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_101_02">The enemy are at the gates, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_77_01">Through the tunnels and get to the beach, gentlemen!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_a_10">Uh, I hope I got this right...</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_07">We should&apos;ve switched fucking cars!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_80_01">This is weird guys. The boards are lighting up like crazy. Something&apos;s wrong... I think we have major trouble coming. Damn it, I knew this was shady.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_34_03">The manufacturers call it a heavy-duty industrial drilling apparatus, but heisters know it as The Beast. Gentlemen, start it up.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_09_02">I will move to the building next door. Enter across the roof and you can meet me there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_random_brf_speak_04">OK people, my guy says this is a good time to hit the bank. Turns out the Harvest &amp; Trustee bank manager should have kept his mouth shut. Anything could be in here.</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_01_03">Jingle their motherfucking bells!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_09_03">Great. It&apos;s working! </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_27_03">Oh, I didn&apos;t know we were in a Sci-Fi movie. Well, okay then. You&apos;re gonna need to find the lead scientist for some kind of hand print authorization.See where he&apos;s hiding.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_26_01">What the hell is Commissar working in this room?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_42_03">Look over there. Little cop shits are stealing the money. The fuck is the world coming to! Kill them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_29_01">Now, take him to panic room so he can use the retinal scanner. Should work.</string>
	 <string id="sys_hb2_04_01">Raising security door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_53_02">There&apos;s a finder&apos;s fee for all the evidence you pull out of the safe house. I have to safe guard crime.net and it&apos;s contacts.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_16_02">Come on, gang. Find a blowtorch.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_09_02">That was the wrong terminal. Keep trying. Look for some clue, clock is ticking and we need to find the right one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_141_01">The main lobby.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_16_any_01">We are going to need ingredients, so scout the place and see what you can find.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_38_01">And... yes, that is a satisfactory piece of business! All of the bags! Now, please, attach yourselves to the cables, join me up here and let us meet in person!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_28_01">The screws, friends. The screws.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_67_02">Ok, let me see...</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_10_02">You heard the man! You can either steal more things or you get on that bike and ride! Ride like the wind!</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_end_01_03">Good work, my friends! Can&apos;t wait to see how those Murky bastards explain that one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_48_03">We came for the ones in cases, but everything else is gravy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_05_any_01">Greed is your guide. If you want it, go get it. </string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_08_03">Another guard. Stay hidden.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_67_01">C&apos;mon, get a drill going on that door.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_04_02">Hey! Get this gate open!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_12_02">Detonator is counting down. Keep the kerels away from it. Don&apos;t need them cutting it, for sure.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_06a_any_02">I&apos;ll be there in one minute...</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_08_any_02">OK, cool - might come in handy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_21_any_03">OK folks, so here&apos;s what I did: I got you an escape chopper - thank me later - he&apos;s on his way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_63a_01">Enter MercyKill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_03_any_02">Check for the safe guys. Got to be there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_03_05">I&apos;m going to assume muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_07_03">Everyone knows it&apos;s on the ground floor, even the tourists!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_09_02">Let it rain!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_06_03">Chopper will come back for you, so while we&apos;re waiting, why not get looking for Vlad&apos;s packages. Could be a nice little bonus.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_14_02">Good. Keep the cops off of it.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_06_03">You are skilled and silent infiltrators. We should work together more often.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_06">He only had a week left on his contract.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_03_01">Gang, the computer station there could be useful. See if you can find me a laptop or something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_05_01">The cops have sent an patrol to investigate. They&apos;ll be here soon.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_13_02">Wrong one, maybe you need to have another look?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_15_01">Another cop car have arrived to help out. You know how to deal with them. </string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_19_02">Good, now hurry up and turn the lights back on or people will get suspicious and sound the alarm.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_15_01">West Wing should be open to you now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_39_any_01">Snipers! On the roof.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_49_01">Guys! Use the keycards in the dock control rooms. Get the dock gate open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_12_any_01">Looks like we&apos;ve hit the jackpot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_34_02">What a drill. Let&apos;s see if it works as good as it looks. Fire it up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_10_01">I count four guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_47_03">We know the call originated in West End. Look for something to give us a precise address. West End.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_67_02">Mobster down. That should get Commissar&apos;s attention.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_05_02">Back door looks good. Crack it open with a saw, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_12_03">Now, we have a little jol with the Commissioner. Go find his office, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_150_02">The blueprints are in the archives. My guess would be the employee only areas.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_intro_01">Houston, come here. Shh, keep quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_13_any_05">Score! I can hear Vlad smiling from here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_17">Hurry! They&apos;re flushing down bag after bag of coke and it looks like they&apos;re enjoying it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_33_01">You gotta go back and check the mainframe again for the second artifact. Make it fast, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_22_01">Alright, now, this is your safe house, this is where you spend your time off duty. It&apos;s not much at the moment, but give it some time. I&apos;m working on it. I&apos;ll let you do some decorating yourself soon.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_70_02">The code will be stored on the auctioneer&apos;s PC, so get hacking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_60_03">Come on friends, it&apos;s not going to carry itself, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_19_03">I bet those wagons have loot. Check &apos;em out. Keep an eye open for C4 too.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_28_03">You got to find Garrett&apos;s safe.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_03_01">These fuckers chained me up! Get this shit off me!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_19_03">That alarm is bringing in more porky reinforcements. Shut it down, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_41_03">That chute there can transport the loot to the back rooms of...</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_24_01">Where did they hide that fucking VR set? In an alternate reality?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_07_01">That should be all of them. Nice work!</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_09_02">Oh, you know we aren&apos;t leaving without some of those weapons. We just need to get them out of here some way...</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_13_03">Ach, that&apos;s not good. No way to break that open silently, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_07_any_01">Pick-up coming in one minute. Don&apos;t let up now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_29_02">The way is blocked. You gotta find the controls to the walkway and extend it!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_18_03b">They shot me, but it&apos;s only a minor one. Barely hurts.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_intro_03_02">It&apos;s going to be another one of those days, for sure.$NL;</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_16_any_01">We got four!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_20_03">We need approval from the security station. I would do it myself, but alas...</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_93_03">Everyone has gotta get on the chopper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_03_any_02">Hang tight! Hang tight! I&apos;m searching for an escape driver right God damn now!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_03_05">I would really appreciate some help with those snipers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_78_03">The C4 is for blowing the gate. Get it placed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_02d_01">You&apos;ve defeated the second wave of cops!</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap07_08">It&apos;s that fucking Russian. He&apos;s behind this. Do your fucking job and end this invasion of my privacy!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_35_01">Ah, it&apos;s stuck. Gonna need to shoot it down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_brf_01">The Elephant doesn&apos;t like losing elections. He wants us to tamper with the voting machines headed to his district. We&apos;re going to the docks to put a GPS tracker on the truck carrying the machines. This will allow us to intercept the truck and deal with the machines before the election.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_23_03">Pour him a drink. Once he takes a sip, the little something we added should... well, he&apos;s going to run for the nearest toilet. Follow him. Get his keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_59_03">Okay, she&apos;s drilling down into the vault. You keep her safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_34_03">That&apos;s the last piece of the code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_156_02">Outstanding crew. The door&apos;s opening. All you need to do now is disable those lasers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_intro_01_01">Find the railcar with the turret. You might be able to find an access card somewhere to speed things up.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_13_02">Uh, fuck....reporting a near miss. Coming around again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_05_02">Great. Bag that body and get it out of sight before someone sees it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_11_02">Great. Now get back to the terminal and restart that download!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_13_06">Garrett&apos;s office is around there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_09_02">See that copy machine? It has the goods should this caper go loud. But let&apos;s try and not let them happen, huh?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_21_01">Now the fun part - steal a car! I&apos;ll blast the road - take cover!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_44_02">The keys should be nearby. See if you can find them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_06_03">How&apos;s he going to get you out of this?</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_18_any_01">Those tunnels will lead you into the warehouse.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_114_01">This is one of the ship Control Rooms. Computers can be used for entering GPS targets. There could also be a keycard or radio here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_34_01">That&apos;s it. Good! I&apos;m waiting for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_57_01">Almost there, gang. Any second now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_06_any_01">Looks like some codes, that&apos;ll come in handy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_28_02">Find Garrett&apos;s safe, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_20_any_06">Acid, guys, acid. Get some and pour it in there. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_67_05">Good. Now reset the computer and we can continue.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_33_03">Nice, that should do it for the roof.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_20_02">Clearly, this guy is fanatical. He even made his place of prayer into a puzzle. Find the missing pieces to that shrine. </string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_16_03">Might be a good idea to get that tarp off.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_82_01">Knock knock! Now let&apos;s find the prisoner!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_17_01">Flush it down the toilet! It will mix with the rest of the kak.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_109_07">What&apos;re you still doing there? Get on the helicopter.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_09_01">Look for the manager. Balding, black suit. Tie him down and see if he has more information.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_57c_02">I read in the newspaper that sharks almost never kill people. But there you go, eh?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_33_03">More Murky guards are on the way. Don&apos;t think we&apos;ve been discovered, but be extra careful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_24_03">Plan A is out the window, we&apos;re gonna have to gamble that the server is there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_09_03">We should have used caustic soda!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_04_01">Come on friends, you have the thermite. Get inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_18_any_02">OK the escape driver&apos;s coming in hot as hell! I think he&apos;s going to get shot up if you don&apos;t cover him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_00_02">Put on the mask and let&apos;s get this thing started.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_18_01">Uh, guys...what&apos;s that noise?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_70_02">Good, we got what we need. Murkywater and the Dentist will be in big trouble once this hits home.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_12_any_01">Goddammit - they locked you out! Find a way around!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_10_01">Ready guys?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_51_any_01">Damn it! The alarm! The whole house knows we are coming now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_07_01">Watch for anything odd.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_12_02">Come on, keep looking. Have you checked every roof? I know it&apos;s in the area.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_57_02">Easy now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_06_02">There should be two of them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_62_02">Nothing. Damn! Are there more around?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_09_01">...Find a terminal in the mainframe to hack into, see if you can figure out where to go next, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_73_02">You have to find that cell block!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_29_03">Ok, there&apos;s nothing left to steal. Get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_13_02">We&apos;re almost there. Time to patch through to my pilot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_104_01">Ok, guys. Chopper is back so get to loading again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_47_02">I see SWAT vans rolling into the neighbourhood coming from the east. Dig in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_39_any_02">They heard the drill! The alarm&apos;s been triggered!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_66_01">Use the keycard to get inside the server room. It&apos;s on the second floor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_79_02">There... that looks useful.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_12_02">The vault code reshuffles every 10 minutes for extra security. Put a blocker on the keypad to lock the code in place.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_05_01">Ach, the door is locked. Buluc likes to keep his wine safe. You&apos;ll need to find the code to unlock it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_111_01">Dammit! The plane snagged the cage but there was no goddamn cash. You guys need to pick it up and haul it out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_24_02">Ok, now for overriding the main panel.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_snipers_deployed_02">Watch out! They are bringing in a sniper team by chopper!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_65_03">The auctioneer has fled the building! You&apos;ll never get the keycard now, so just stick a drill on that door and bore it open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_63_01">Here it is! Take the bomb parts to the drop-off point!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_50_02">Ach, I&apos;m being stopped by a firewall. Get to one of the other computers and see if you can help me through.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_70_01">Bile is on the way. Hang in there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_20_02">Right friends, that&apos;s the right place. Go out to the main hub and use the crane.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_24_03">Right. Now find the comms relay and get access. We can make it look like the call is coming from the house.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_21_03">Charon? What&apos;s up, you ok?</string>
	 <string id="ism_al1_01_01">Step into the closet when you&apos;re ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_28_03">Watch out for those turrets, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_32_01">You can dump bodies into the sea through the windows.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_02_05">I give you these toys and all you want to do is stay in the box. Move it!</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_04_10">When this is over, what say we fucking buy that beach Bain was talking about?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_44_03">Well, it&apos;s a keycard, and pretty damn useless now. Maybe if you&apos;d found it earlier...</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_15_02">That ain&apos;t the sweet music of the children of the night. </string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_01_01">Almost there. Blerrie, what a job this one is going to be!  I managed to dig up a little more intel with help from Joy. To get into the PEOC, you will need one of the special keycards they use. The most likely place to find one will be in the Oval Office. </string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_28_any_02">Stay clear of the guards.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_61_02">Now get your sombreros on and into that tunnel.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap07_02">Sanchez, where the fuck is Raúl? Someone is shooting up the place.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_10_03">Looks like Matt&apos;s vehicle has crashed. Go check if he&apos;s alive!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_13">...hope this website is accurate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_19_03">They made you! Do something - quick!</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_10_01">The incoming group has Minigun Dozers!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_30_01">Come on, we don&apos;t have much time, extend the walkway.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_06_to_departure">The escape vehicle is leaving in six minutes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_intro_04">If you chops find a guitar case full of guns... just let it be, yeah?  </string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_33_any_02">Are you looking for the tiara?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_h_04">We need caustic soda!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_09_02">Don&apos;t let the cops reach the hacking device! Now you&apos;re gonna have to reboot it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_07_any_01">Good start, now get the rest!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_14_03">As before, gang. Get that cage prepared.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_18_01">I got you an escape van, just outside the main entrance!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_51_01">Nothing more to do here. Let&apos;s go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_22_any_01">Add caustic soda to continue the process!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_34_03">That&apos;s it for the fifth floor. Excellent.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_05_03">Cover me while I open the door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_intro_01_01">Commissar&apos;s gonna be antsy after the motel attack, but he won&apos;t be expecting this. Masks on and give the rat what he deserves. Good luck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_52_03">Damn! Alright. Expect company, gang!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_84_01">I think Rust mentioned this room. Maybe there&apos;s something useful in there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_04_03">Looks like you&apos;re going to have to go in through the back door. Use a saw to crack it open, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_07_01">A gas tank and exhaust pipes, gang. That&apos;s what the mechanic said he needed, and you&apos;ll find them in the workshop.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_03_04">Is it safe to come out yet? Are those loud bangs firecrackers?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_20_03">Crap! Alright, forget about using the zip-line. Our guy had to run when the cops showed up.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_57_any_02">It&apos;s getting dangerous here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_08_01">You have to steal Tin Boy!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_35_01">Keep looking for those winch parts, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_30_03">The walkway controls... find them!</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_11_01">OK, missing some files. Witness testimonies, kept in the Archives. Get me those files!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_26_02">Get out of there guys!</string>
	 <string id="plt_flt_14_01">Ok I&apos;m pulling this shit out of here. You guys keep the cops at bay!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_56_01">Good job! Now drop off the loot into the vent leading into the basement area.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_14_01">OK, looks like the the panic room door is controlled with a code and two keycards. Find them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_02_03">Expect very tight security here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_03_02">Hope he doesn&apos;t hit a hill. Keep the cops at bay.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_end_a_02">No more Mendozas. You gave them a true Viking funeral, except they&apos;re not Vikings. Sad. </string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_25_01">Check outside the Velvet Room for a PC.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_67_04">Burn baby! Now make sure the kerels don&apos;t put it out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_01_02">Let&apos;s free Santa Claus!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_163_01">We have some excellent lobster tails for you to enjoy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_02_any_01">I&apos;m starting the clock. Look for a safe. If it&apos;s not in the safe - don&apos;t panic - it&apos;s in the building.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_89_03">All the clues to the puzzle are now in your hands. Use them to solve the puzzle.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_52_02">According to Rust, these biker keks keep lots of breaching charges around. </string>
	 <string id="hoxton_hb3_debrief_01_03">Fucking Hector. What makes a man spread his asshole for the feds like that. Ah, fuck it. Great work lads.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_79_03">Look for something that&apos;s good for breaching doors!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_01b">Fortune and glory, kid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_11_02">Get back to the helicopter and secure the BCI tech! </string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_11_any_01">Hey, everyone! Don&apos;t forget the bags!</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_17_02">Don&apos;t worry, it will be fine. Ah! Here he comes! </string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_12_any_01">Alright, our dealer is arriving, hold on for a second.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_34_02">You still have to find the second artifact.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_52_any_02">All the extra loot goes into all the pockets. The more, the better!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage2_09_any_01">Although we didn&apos;t bring the amount of meth that we promised, we can still go ahead with the deal. But be prepared in case things go south.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_27_02">Go get the lance, badasses!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_51_02">You have to restart the hack!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_12_02">We&apos;re not getting through that door without a key... It&apos;s time we find this Chavez. He&apos;s in charge and should have the key.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_38_02">We can&apos;t go lifting the container while you&apos;re inside there. Follow the plan!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_73_01">You need to reach the wine cellar!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_26_01">Gang, without something to hack the vault system, we&apos;re not getting it open. Keep looking!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_30_02">Console on the left!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_12_03">In, but the alarm is counting. Find the lockdown and shut it off before it goes off. Let&apos;s try and keep this quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_11_any_01">The escape van will be in an alley nearby, get ready to hustle.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_04_01">Great, keep &apos;em coming!</string>
	 <string id="pln_can_02_02">Find the elves in the toyshop. You need to shout at them to get them making toys again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_10_to_arrival">The escape vehicle will be there in ten minutes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_103_01">Ok friends, get ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_05_any_01">Find me his server room. I will scan his stuff for info on the arms deal.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_09_02">The wheel stopped on smoke, no idea what that means.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_41_any_03">You got made.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_10_07">Hydrogen chloride is what you want!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fourstores_stage1_end_b_02">Vlad&apos;s reputation will rise. You guys will get a nice little payday from this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_15_01">Three.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_106_01">Federales are coming in from the roof!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_33_02">Get back into the mainframe and find the second box&apos;s location.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_29_02">Don&apos;t forget about Garrett, yeah? He&apos;s not going to be gone long.</string>
	 <string id="loc_run_02_01">Scanning target&apos;s location... got it, there he is!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_60_06">You need to take the box.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_end_03_01">Sweet, sweet gold! Great job everyone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_88_01">That&apos;s one for our client, and one each for you ultimate badasses. But don&apos;t stop.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_55_01">Got it. Doors should be open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_19_03">Dallas. That console panel could actually be very useful. Try it out and see if you can find the computer. That would save us some time.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_02_01">First thing to do is open that hatch to get inside. Once you&apos;re in, expect trouble right away.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_12_01">There you go, better get those stones to Mr Blonde. His boss will be able to move them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_35_03">OK, we go loud! That panic room is secure, so you&apos;ll need a thermal lance to get through. It&apos;s on the way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_19_02">Get those bags. They have the pieces of the cage. You need to put it together in the street.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_17_01">Remember we&apos;re after the voting machines. We need to hack them to turn the favor towards McKendrick. Look for them in shipping crates.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_42_01">Turn the water back on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_55_02">Alright. Great. Lets see if he takes the bait...</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_24_01">Now we&apos;re gotta go in blind. Do it good!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_47_02">Take a step back, this is going to cause a ruckus.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_23_any_02">I hope they&apos;re insured... </string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_53b_any_01">... everything else is gravy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_101_01">Just wait until it&apos;s clear.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_59_03">That&apos;s it, on the table. Pick it up, get out of there and keep it away from the kerels, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_96_07">Plug in some new batteries.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_15_03">The second pallet! Good. But good things come in threes. Like that week all my wives died. Find the third pallet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_32_any_01">Guys, it&apos;s fewer bags than we expected, but we can still do the trade and hope they agree to give us the information.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_09_01">Bain will make the call with the pass phrase.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_16_any_01">Alright now, I have access, hold on a sec...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_22_02">GUYS, wait the vault it&apos;s electrified!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_50_01">Is anyone going to pick up the phone?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_98_01">Get the key for our friend!</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_01_03">This next part is noisy. Noisy, and dirty and smelly. I can&apos;t wait. Let&apos;s do this, huh?</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_03_03">I have a man on the way for you. Boris?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_01_03">OK, friends! We&apos;re going to be touching down near the South Portico. There are Murkys everywhere, so be ready. To get into the PEOC you&apos;re going to need a keycard and I think we should start looking for one in the West Wing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_39_02">Run, heisters, run!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_12_03">Tick-tock, said the detonator. Keep the kerels away. </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_38_04">The lasers turned off yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_59a_03">Remember - the explosive might have thrown the loot across the room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_17_any_01">Get into the van! Get in the van!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_07_05">Wait a second...</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_27_01">The control room is up there. You see?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_55_01">You need to get inside the police station.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_93_01">What are you waiting for, use the thermite!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_64_any_01">Get them off me!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_45_any_01">Get to the chopper to escape!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_54_03">For a police station, this is about as tough as they come.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_04_03">Listen up, we&apos;re gonna put these folks into goddamn ecstacy. When I say, you hit the button. All right!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_35_01">There&apos;s the alarm, gentlemen. Start the countdown.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_92_03">If you turn the ventilation system to full, you should be able to clear out that gas.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_120_03">Signal the chopper on the roof whenever you&apos;re ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_23_01">Well! That&apos;s the last bag down the pan. Sorry, gang - no extra income this time around.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_04_01">He&apos;s fucking asleep? Wake him up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_41_03">There you go! Almost home free.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_107_04">Time to get in! Now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_10_03">This one&apos;s a wash-out. Another one. Quick!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_06_01">OK, I trust you hear me loud and clear. Alright, we don&apos;t have any time to waste, let&apos;s just get to it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_31_02">That timer on the wall&apos;s ticking fast! Get the loot into the vent!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_10_03">You must reconnect hose, is pumping air!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_68_01">Bile is going to need some help to find you. Light a flare!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_69_01">You gotta restart the drill!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_26_03">They&apos;ve booby-trapped it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_37_03">That&apos;s not optimal... but it happened. Go to the balcony!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_85_03">You need to start drilling.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_64_01">You still need to bypass security, so find those two routers!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_19_12">It is foolish to steal from the Continental!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_48_02">Right guys, if you make your way out by the Jack Rabbit Slim&apos;s, the cops will hopefully follow you so that Blonde can get the car out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_35_02">A couple years ago, some civvie chop got all they way past the Secret Service and stole a pair of knickers from the First Lady. It&apos;s true, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_04_03">That&apos;s typical. You should have a look in the clubhouse in case these dwankies have left a way to access the code somewhere. Start with the briefing room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_intro_01_03">OK, time to steal some cars.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_12_01">Come on friends, get cracking with those cameras.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_35_01">Wait for the helicopter.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_85_02">Hurry up and get to the West Wing, chop chop!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_16_02">Now put your sombreros on and get into that tunnel.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_24_02">The Murky contraband we&apos;re after will be money. Could be kept anywhere nearby, so you&apos;re just going to have to search for it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_20_03">Badasses on deck! Great job stealthing it. Containers are unlocked. Go for it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_05_03">Search all boxes you find. I won&apos;t risk missing the BCI tech because Rust&apos;s information was wrong.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_24_02">Hey, on the upper floor there&apos;s a high-voltage box. Sabotage it and you should be fine to handle the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_01_any_01">Trash the entire mall. Either destroy each store individually, or look for something to torch them all.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_34_01">Second number. Just one more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_36_01">Listen up, gang. I&apos;m sending in a boat to pick you up. Look for the small water access near the river.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_84_01">Two</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_13_03">You need to get to the tech lab and find the right shelf.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_16_03">You&apos;ll need to drill that gate to get the briefcase!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_03_03">That box controls the gate. A little creativity should get them open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_65_03">Boat&apos;s standing by to get you out, guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_09_02">Perhaps there was interference on the radio, so let me repeat. Plant the fucking charges on the locks. Please.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_01_02">If he&apos;s going to hide away, we&apos;ll have to draw him out. You could start destroying his treasured possessions and see if that does it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_brief_b_01">Alright team, this jewelry store has a number of display cases flaunting some medium range gems and gold. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_10_02">Sounds like a present fell outta the tree, gang. Might be more of Vlad&apos;s coke. Find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_08_03">You&apos;re across! Now grab that stone!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_56_03">You not going to have a look behind the doors?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_11_any_01">Time for us to go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_14_04">No fat copper is going to fall through that floor and make it bigger, friends. You gotta blow it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_05_any_01">Excellent! Keep that drill going.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_21_03">Great, now get into that Falcogini. I&apos;ll clear the road. Heads down!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_47_01">No need to sneak about now. Locke has a plan B!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_20_01b">I don&apos;t want to be a douche, I really don&apos;t, but that coke ain&apos;t getting here itself, you know?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_07d_02">Nice work! The seventh wave was beaten back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_46_02">Nice! Go through the gate and head to the vault. Find the counting room and pour out the thermite. We&apos;re burning down to the vault!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_24_03">C&apos;mon, friends. Don&apos;t take too long. Disable those boxes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_32_01">Put the box on the conveyor, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_51_02">Guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_11_02">Time&apos;s wasting. Start getting that vault open now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_15_01">All right. Head to reception, find a terminal and download the guest list.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_03_01">Well, look... I&apos;m going to send some guys over there to check on things.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_04_03">You should find the chief&apos;s office on the upper floor. The evidence should be on his computer.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_25_03">It would be beautiful if we could do this with you hiding in the airlock, but... alas...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_70_01">All right! Not a single camera left to watch our shenanigans. Great work.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_78_02">Just give me a second...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_12_02">Pilot&apos;s gone down. Don&apos;t let him pass out. Get him moving!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_54_01">One down, one to go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_66_06">Can&apos;t shoot that cannon without batteries.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_67_02">The cops shut off the power, turn it back on!</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_07_05">Yeah, that&apos;s it. Ah fuck! This is beautiful!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_42_01">Okay, the data is being transferred to the server in the other room. You can either go and get it or stay and scan more bodies. I&apos;m sure Jimmy can find use for it and that means more cash for us.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_13_01">More coppers coming soon. Blonde needs that bag.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_06_01">There you go, now make your way further into the facility. And be careful, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_brf_01">Our client needs a blood sample from a patient being kept in the isolation ward of Mercy Hostpital. You gotta go in there, take out the surveillance, subdue the civilians and get me into the patient database so I can ID the guy. With the low security in this place, it should be a nice, clean job. I&apos;ll get you out via the roof when you&apos;re done. This job is a little shady, brokered through a third party- got some serious shadow-company military industrial vibes, but worth the risk. The payday is something we&apos;re gonna need in the future, plus a nice cash bonus.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_45_01">Bile&apos;s on-site, gang. Start getting the bags to him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_21_03">Now, find the encrypted flash drive we came for. It should be in a laptop.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_26_any_10">That&apos;s 14!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_81_01">Stick some explosives on the gate and we&apos;re good to go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_26_01">Ah kak - those poes are bringing in more SWAT turrets, with the express purpose of bringing me down. All right, I can&apos;t pick you up in town, but I am prepared for this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_52_03">That&apos;s it. Stay and grab more of get out. Your call.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_12_03">Ride, boys and girls, ride!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_91_03">There&apos;s gotta be something volatile around there you can use!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_74_01">They&apos;re dropping off guys on the roof. Get up there and deal with &apos;em.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_10_any_02">OK people, the pick-up drive is here! He&apos;s on the street behind you!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_13">It doesn&apos;t look good, guys - it doesn&apos;t look good!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_24_02">Alright. Get access to the comms. We&apos;re gonna make a call.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_28_02">Time to skedaddle you chops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_03_02">Great, now get down to the garage. Our Inside Man has marked up where you need to plant the c4.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_25_any_09">That&apos;s 13 bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_27_03">That&apos;s great. Thank you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_19_01">Great. Our second door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_31_any_01">Awesome! With all those bags, the trade should be smooth.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_08_06">Paging Dr McCoy... Dr McCoy?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_10">Every now and then, just don&apos;t trust me, guys.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_01_02">Just three minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_intro_a_01b">And don&apos;t drop it...</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_11_any_03">OK, this is a fight - they will destroy the intel!</string>
	 <string id="csf_cs1_02_01">Yeah, how much money do I got in there? How much?</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_16_any_02">SWATs just breached the wall! </string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_57_03">OK, start the next hack.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_18_01">Looks like he&apos;s running dry. Bring him another with a little extra flavor in it. I&apos;m sure you can find a bottle in one of the bars and spike it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_18_02">The job wasn&apos;t a total bust. Still, fewer stuffed bags than under Leatherface&apos;s stairs!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_102_03">Collect all of Vlad&apos;s &quot;precious&quot; loot and take it to the garbage truck, chop chop!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_18_01">Probably a good idea to shut off that alarm. There&apos;s a button for it somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_11_01">Another package hit the ground, clowns. Try and find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_14_04">Fires&apos; out. You did well, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_114_02">Damn it guys, you&apos;ve been left for dead by Bile. He&apos;s gonna get it later...</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_17_03">Ah shit, this one broke on impact. We got bundles of cash scattered about. You&apos;re going to have to find them, bag them and get them back here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_33_03">Hit the left and the middle.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_intro_02_01">Why Switzerland?$NL;</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_09_03">Now we need to code the tag for access. Get it to the computer!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_13_02">For crying out loud, the pilot has hit the deck again. Wake him up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_105_01">You need three colored digits to enter the armory. Or guess.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_05_01">Better find that computer, friends.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_08_02">Nice and easy guys. This one is important.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_26_03">Ok, the flare is lit. Great job guys, now just wait for Bile.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrasch_stage1_intro_a_01">Go into the mall and rough up whatever you see. Keep civilians out if you can - we don&apos;t need unnecessary heat. </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_43_02">Once we are outside you will see our escape helicopter, as well as a large array of advanced radar equipment. State of the art. It could track us anywhere west of the Rockies.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_27_02">Keep searching the motel, guys. There has to be some clue to where the Commissar is.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_163_04">We have a fine selection of rare meats from Africa. You ever sampled elephant?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_37_02">We&apos;re using the roof as our pick-up spot. Over.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_c2_02">I&apos;m going with caustic soda.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_end_b_02">Burning 100 million dollars is a hell of a thing. It makes me feel like a real banker. All in a day&apos;s work. See you at the safe house. </string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_03_03">You should use your thermite to get inside the mansion walls.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_38_03">And... Great. Their grid is weakening. Do another.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_16">These are some determined fucking law enforcers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_07_any_01">That&apos;s the tablet PC. Perfect.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_28_02">Now, only one vault can be opened at a time, and not all vaults are containing the loot. I will leave it to you to figure out which is worth opening. </string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_68_01">We need a viral concentration of 65% or more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_49_03">FBI Ready Teams are on their way! Those bastards were on standby in the nearby houses!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_23_02">Great, you found it. One of you get up there.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_02_03">Fucking piece of shit car! Need a hand out here guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_20_02">Now let&apos;s rescue our friend. The cell block should be nearby.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_11_01">The first pallet hit the ground around here somewhere. Find it, mark the position and I&apos;ll come and collect it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_20_01">You&apos;ll have to use the blowtorch to get through this gate. Make it quick.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_46_02">Try another key!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_39_01">Hey guys, there&apos;s nothing left. Get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_16_02">Remember to sneak under the cameras so they won&apos;t spot you.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_25_01">Got it! I got the goats!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_100_03">Look out for the gas, friends! Wait until it dissipates!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_12_03">Find Bain&apos;s cell with the cameras.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_01_any_01">OK guys, get into the bank and find the vault and drill it open. Make sure no one triggers the alarm or escapes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_33_01">That&apos;s the first number. Need two more.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_27_01">You need to take care of those Murkys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_92_06">One more time</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_61_02">Damn, they know you&apos;re there now for sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_33_01">Give him the earpiece!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_05_01">Good work. That ammo will fetch a nice price.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_13_01">Pick that bag up, it&apos;s some cash to start you off, get it to the living room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_48_02">That&apos;s right. C4 each of those dishes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_70_02">Ach, the alarm is sounded!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_30_01">Boom! How&apos;s that for a deposit, Benevolent!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_03_02">Come on, you need to get inside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_38_01">There should be uniforms in the locker room, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_45_01">Hell yeah, it&apos;s open! Get down there! </string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_cbf_01">Dear Friends, we&apos;re going back to New York. Theres something buried in the foundation of the old Brooklyn Bank that Bain was after. Could be a way out of this current predicament we&apos;re in. While we&apos;re there, it might be a good idea to pick up some extra operating cash to keep us going. Replacing all of Bain&apos;s equipment isn&apos;t going to be cheap I can tell you, and the stuff I&apos;ve got running as backup isn&apos;t going to hold up for long, yeah? At the moment, we&apos;re open targets.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_11">He was officer material. Was! </string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_15_any_02">Fuck! That&apos;s landmines. Keep off the grass and stay out of the camera view.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_47_03">That&apos;s a strange looking dinges, yeah? Put in on a zipline chop chop!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_75_01">Ach, it&apos;s blocked. Can&apos;t use C4 either. Check that R-FID reader!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_63_03">It&apos;s firing! Get outta the way... Now!</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_09_03">Hey guys, it&apos;s been.. interesting.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_08w_01">Ok, here comes the eighth wave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_98_01">They&apos;re crazy! Shooting up the building with missiles! What the hell is this?!</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_04">And stay...you grass-chewin&apos;, horn-growin&apos;, freaky-eyed MOTHERFUCKER!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_98_02">Open that second vault and you&apos;ll get a juicy bonus.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_98_02">I sent along a new drill for you. It&apos;s based on an older model but this one will not jam.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_kb1_01">You&apos;ve got to keep at least 1 bag!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_43_02">...Maybe someone forgot a keycard or something.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_59_any_03">I got to go in a minute!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_99_03">You came for the ones in cases, but everything else is a bonus.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_23_01">Perfect! Now, give it a few seconds and we should be done.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_15_06">Get to the far back and join up with Twitch!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_15_03">That is the server, gang! 25 million dollars can be ours! Now we need to act. </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_41_03">We can get to know each other over whiskey and cigars later, because I feel that now would be the perfect time for a getaway, yes?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_21">If you get up there fast enough, we&apos;ll make a fortune. Come on! Make an effort!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_02_02">The leak willl be in the basement. See Mitchell about it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_01_01">Signal the driver when you&apos;re ready to go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_69_02">The Murky resources we&apos;re after will be money. Could be kept anywhere nearby, so you&apos;re just going to have to search for it.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_12_02">Are you fuckin&apos; havin&apos; a laugh? There&apos;s a server missing. The log says it was taken to IT for maintenance. We need that server.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_34_03">Center. And right!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_88_03">Bile is on the way with the chopper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_28_02">Hey, if you don&apos;t find the lead scientist, you&apos;re not getting through that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_cafe_03_to_departure_01">Alright guys, we&apos;ve got a three minute window here. Get moving!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_111_03">Bile&apos;s waiting to ditch the winch. Light the flare for him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_17_01">Kerels got to the terminal. You&apos;ve got to restart the hack.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_63_02">What kind of animal would do a thing like this? And now we need to chop off his hand... </string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_62_01">Go through the hole! Head to the neighboring building!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_15_01">Go inside and drop the bag on the table so you can count it. I hope everything is there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_33_03">Just leave the car in the container and mosey on out. We&apos;re nearly done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_02_02">There&apos;s a lot of stuff coming home. Weapons, ammo and anything that murkier elements can liberate. Check Murkywater&apos;s containers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_overpass_sniper_on_rooftop_02">A sniper is about to set up a position on the opposite side of the highway. Be ready...</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_13_01">Guys, the pilot is circling! Drop the flare!</string>
	 <string id="rb22_sah_intro_03a">I could see myself living in a place like this. If it were, you know, less creepy.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_11_02">Good, is working again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_38_02">Whoo! That was crazy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_43_03">That did it, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_56_03">Hurry, friends. The detonator! </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_53_01">No telling where they might be though, you&apos;ll have to look around.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_64_02">Thermite&apos;s burned out. You&apos;re all clear. Drop in and start bagging.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_67_02">The gun needs to charge before you can fire it. Look around for a control panel in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_c2_05">...caustic soda?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_70_02">50 percent done.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_34_02">Get to the library, guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_68_01">Ach, kerels have stopped the drill! Get it up again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_60_03">Better get that drill running again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_06_03">We&apos;re kind of on the clock here. A lotta other things to take care of too, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_04d_01">You&apos;ve defeated the fourth wave of cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_11_01">A contact of mine stashed a few body bags nearby just in case.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_03_02">OK... MAKE SURE BULUC SUFFERS LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER WHEN YOU KILL HIM.$NL;</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_07_03">Plan B time guys, they knew we were comin&apos;.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_03_03">Hey, you assholes taking some sun? The trucks, remember?!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap04_03a">Don&apos;t you worry about him. Worry about yourself instead.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_16_02">The cops are inside the house. Silent kills, people! </string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_14_any_01">OK I see it! We&apos;ll be there soon.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_53_01">Kerels have stopped the hack!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_03_03">One high-tech, high-value piece of military badass right there. Drill en-route.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_68_01">Now get that gasoline on a car and torch it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_12_02">Good. The computer is working again without interruption.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_05_any_01">Fill it up, and I&apos;ll come back for more later!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_26_01">Head to the pyro booth. Top floor. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_cbf_01">Every Christmas I set up a little operation - gifts for the children, and &quot;gifts&quot; for the parents, yes?  Thing is, supplies are low this year. But! I have found an alternative. A clutch of assholes have an operation near here. Consider it a little toyshop, yes. I need you to get down there, take out the muscle and get the &quot;elves&quot; back to work.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_03_02">You&apos;re breaking up... Can you hear me ok?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_36_01">Damn! The containers got locked when the alarm was triggered. Gonna have to drill them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_16_02">Alright, I&apos;m in. I&apos;ll pop that lock for you in a sec. Right now I need you to get back out front, grab the C4 and get it on the street.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_10_03">Gang, get into the house. Come on, move it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_09_01">First router has been hacked.</string>
	 <string id="blm_cs1_01_02">Hey, assholes. You want me to keep my fingers off 911? Then throw a moneybag over the yellow wall by the auto-repair shop. Do it, now! An&apos; I see one of you motherfuckers try and get a bag across the street, I&apos;m onto the cops.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_58_03">If you can&apos;t find him, make sure to check all floors of the building.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_20">The police is on our back like a fucking pony tail here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_01_02">Locke, what are you up to? You better not be messing with my crew.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_02_03">Two wall-mounted router boxes control the vault security system and each one needs to be hacked separately. Once you&apos;re in, I can do the rest and shut down the system from here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_08_01">Found that office yet? Maybe look upstairs?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_13_01">Time to head for the roof where the helicopter will pick you up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_138_03">Reception. Okay, we may need it later - note where it is.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_79_04">Find something that can take down a reinforced door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_45_01">Ok last step, let&apos;s open her up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_06_02">Looks like a good place to check for clues.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_28_02">Looks like they haven&apos;t had time to get the wiring behind the wall. Find the switch.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_requirement_10_bags">Remember guys, we need ten bags to escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_103_03">Guards are down. Don&apos;t worry about the cameras now. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_04_01">There&apos;s the drop. Snatch it and place it by the lab.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_72_02">Gang, Gensec truck. Hey, it might be carrying a keycard. You know what to do. Get at them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_101_03">Don&apos;t worry, I have a backup plan. There&apos;s a helicopter incoming.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_102_01">That&apos;s the guard down. Don&apos;t have to worry about the cameras anymore.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_42_02">Here&apos;s the second control room. Between the two, we can open the gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_05_01">Next step - open the vault. Find some crowbars inside the warehouse and jam them into the cooling fans at the back. That&apos;ll raise the temperature within, and engage the failsafe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_11_any_02">Keep cooking people. Tempo!</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_24_01">Back to work, keep me covered.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_intro_a_02">Take the coke to the harbor. Signal the boat with the floodlights and he&apos;ll come and get it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_37_02">Hey, great. You found the keycard ahead of schedule.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_10_03">Damn! Cops are sending everyone they got. Time to make this a blood diamond. Find security!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_160_03">Um, my name is, uh... Tony. Why not. I&apos;m calling from Customer Satisfaction here at The Grin.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_07_01">OK, the first database is downloaded. Looks great but it&apos;s not complete. You can haul ass now, or stay and download the whole database. Your call.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_08_01">Right, there&apos;s the access gate. That&apos;s an RFID reader. Nice bit of security, that. Have a look.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_17">They&apos;re firing at the tires!</string>
	 <string id="bkl_brn_01_03">Witness me!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_21_any_01">You need to add the caustic soda to keep the process going!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_107_03">Watch it, friends! Those laanie Mexican police are spreading gas in the vent system. It will clear soon, so stay away until it does!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_10_03">What are you waiting for? Into the docks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_intro_03_01">C4 is in place. Just need to press this button and...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_26_01">Get a keycard and swipe it through the time locks. Check civvies for cards.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_38_06">Find that uniform yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_77_04">When you return next time I won&apos;t be here, but you can always press that button to play a pre-recorded message.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_cbf_01">I have been running guns in the Caribbean for a while. It&apos;s been very profitable, but some of the old movers in the region don&apos;t approve of my presence on the local market. The Bolivian Sosa Cartel specifically. As they could not compete with me on level terms, they decided to attack my operation - sinking one of my ships, stealing my merchandise and killing my operatives. That was very unwise. Now they must pay. You will collect that payment, in blood.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_87_03">Get the vials into the cooler guys. Both of them. Then you get the hell out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_53_02">I think that will work... not that I ever took chemistry, but you can add the next part now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_40_03">Got those tanks mounted yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_04_06">Go find those trucks.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_18_01">You need that keycard, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_32_02">A nice rubber dinghy. All aboard!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_21_02">Find the cell block yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_06_02">Superb! Now, just drop the charges near the main door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_19_04">The Commissar is apparently all &quot;if I can&apos;t have it, neither can anyone else&quot;. He&apos;s cornered, so he has his men flush a mountain of coke down the toilets! Hurry up and stop them, and the coke is yours!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_123_01">All right, the numbers for the code are:</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_07_01">I&apos;m not taking any chances with these boxes. Search &apos;em.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_64_01">Donnerse! That&apos;s what we came for? Grab it and get out of there, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_20_01">No alarm was triggered, so you can simply walk into the containers. Outstanding!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_24_02">Take a nice, long drink, pal.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_34_03">Pick up the pace, head for the library.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_04_01">How&apos;d you guys like to stay overnight in the Lincoln bedroom?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_20_03">Great it is done. Get the keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_22_03">That&apos;s a great place to burn some priceless art.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_08_05">They&apos;ll be digging chunks of cop out of the rubble for weeks!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_72_01">I need that guest list, guys. Send me those files. IT, internet access, upload. Easy!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_76_04">I wonder how much trouble the Commissioner will get into for losing the box.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_44_03">Get to the platorm with the bags!</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_19_01">Ok, you made it so far and the kerels have made an offer. I think we can hold out for more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_intro_a_02">OK folks: you go in, breach the vault with the thermal lance, burn the money and remember to film it. </string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_25_01">Ugh, How slow is this guy?$NL;</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_end_06">DC now has a jewelry shortage - this is where we come in. Well done team!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_07_02">There&apos;s your chopper. Get the bags in it. Then you can bug out, or stay and find more loot. It&apos;s up to you.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap01_02">You piece of shit San Dimas puta! Where the fuck is Miguel? I told you to get him half an hour ago!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_98_01">Luckily, old Locke provided you with a modified drill that is strong enough and will not jam. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_11_01">You heard her. I&apos;ve done a little homework and marked some terminals that should have the 4-digit code in &apos;em somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_03_03">We&apos;re here! I need to get to the server. Drop these feds.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_111_02">Ready for a nice surprise, courtesy of old Locke?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_113_03">That keycard is one less thing we need to open the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_01_01">Get into the store, watch the civilians, watch the cameras and get it done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_20_01">Don&apos;t worry, no one will hear you back here. But keep it down to be safe...</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_15_02">You took care of the cameras, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_87_any_01">Chopper coming in! Roof guys, roof!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_22_any_03">Alex... The idiot dropped the ammo... Elsewhere. </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_26_02">Keep looking for a manual or something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_72_01">We need to keep this place secret. Don&apos;t talk around town about where you are staying. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_124_01">The comm frequency ain&apos;t here. Alright, then check the terminals in the office across the dockyard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_42_02">I got the van in the garage, but you need to go through the elevator shaft.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_64_02">Our patient should have a tattoo on his neck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_124_03">Damn it, no comm frequency here. Alright, there&apos;s an office across the dock. Check there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_17_02">Not far to the Oval Office now. Get in there and find the keycard to the PEOC.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_07_03">This is the penthouse level. Commissar has to be here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_04_01">Rust&apos;s bike isn&apos;t going to roll without an engine, and the mechanic said to check inside the clubhouse. Get a move on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_27_01">Bullseye! That was some flying! Now get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_53_03">Gang. Use the radio. Let me speak to our ship.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_78_01">Now! Tie him down.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_14_any_01">That&apos;s two!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_intro_02">Ach, I should have paid more attention in chemistry class, yeah? No worries, friends... we&apos;ll figure it out as we go.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_54a_any_03">That&apos;s the last one! Perfect!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_15_01">You better look in the boxes, guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_32_05">Only race cars start without keys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_121_02">You can quit searching those cases - you found the bomb!</string>
	 <string id="sys_hb2_11_03">DNA match: positive.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_10_any_02">OK, you guys totally emptied that hangar, time to get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_90_01">Seven bags. You guys are fucking Olympic champions.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_04_any_01">I hope you got a lot of cameras. It&apos;ll make it easier for us to find all the devices.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_26_02">Get that hose re-attached!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_12_02">You&apos;re looking for keycards. The buildings are your best bet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_61_02">Chopper&apos;s retreating! Wonder if Gage can get us SAM&apos;s.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_12_03">Commissar has called in the big guns. The very big guns. Stay away from that chopper!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_55_02">There&apos;s a call coming through to the PEOC. Connect me to it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_09_02">Gensec have upped their game, that&apos;s for sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_02c">I guess this will be a nice change of pace from D.C. and politics, right?</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_end_01_02">Great job gentlemen!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_34_02">You guys are goddamn ghosts. Considerably wealthier ghosts! Well done!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_23_01">Time to start looking for that stash of Murky loot. It&apos;s drugs we&apos;re after. </string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_27_03">The crowd is heaving tonight. Let&apos;s give them a great show.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_05_02">Okay, I have ingredients on their way. Stand by.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_26a_03">Ok, now shoot him! Shoot the piece of shit!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_intro_01_03">Over there. The First World Bank. Okay, get out and get to work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_intro_a_03">Ride or die - that was their motto. Well done. This intel will help us greatly. Study it closely before we hit the scientists house. Let&apos;s go get this fusion engine.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_23_02">Remember, you&apos;re looking for the armory.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_10_01">Don&apos;t forget. Smash the meth into smaller chunks! </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_60_01">What&apos;s that? A blueprint?</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap07_01">Everyone, I am very sorry but we have some uninvited guests and I must therefore now end the party for your safety. Please see yourselves home and thank you for coming.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_26_03">There must be some kind of instruction manual around there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_28_03">Remember - the trap, set it off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_81_02">They cut the power, get it back up! Fast! The elevator won&apos;t move otherwise.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_35_03">You need to get all the winch parts, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cs1_02_02">Can&apos;t do it, Broadsword. Got a lot of wind shear on that vector. Over.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_23_any_03">Alex nailed it. Ammo is right there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_55_02">The radar is still operational. Use the explosives and blow it up.</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_06_01">Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow....</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_46_02">Heads up you chops, the dinges is about to go off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_103_01">Hustle it. Get to armory in the guards locker room! We need that C4!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_06_any_02">Everything&apos;s locked down - if you want me to fix it then I need to get into the surveillance room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_08_03">OK. Whole database is recovered. No point hanging around - get back to the boat.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_brief_b_02">OK crew, this place has a ton of display cases. Smash and grab style, fill those loot bags to the brim. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_04_03">The customer is getting close, standby. </string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_04_03">You&apos;ve got to hack the console! We need to get inside the display cabinet!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_22_07b">Where&apos;s my god damn protection?!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_40_03">You gotta wonder, if the nukes were dropping, would you really want to have to go this far to get to the PEOC?</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_16_01a">Don&apos;t worry my friends, Vlad has arranged some help!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_brf_01_03">Scout the place and hit them hard. Get those jewels and keep the civs at bay. Let&apos;s get rich!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_05_01">Use your ECM Jammer and disable it. That will give you the time needed to lockpick the door.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_29_any_13">That&apos;s 17 bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_04_01">OK, that&apos;s the server. Get the scrambler on there. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_12_01">152!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_76_01">Now, pop some smoke out there so the pilot knows where to drop the equipment.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_11_any_01">OK folks, the pick-up&apos;s here. Cross over that walkway - he is on the other side of that street.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_83_02">Gotta go, friends. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_01_01">OK, OK! I&apos;m on it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_07_01">First of all, besides from that starter kit, another package is awaiting you in the back alley.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_36_02">You need to go to the archaeology room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_78_02">Always exit a social gathering with a bit of flair, friends. Now, secure that box and go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_41_01">Now, there will be time for longer hellos later, but we should really make our escape now, yes?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_86_05">You&apos;ll need something for cutting those chains!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_43_01">Ok, so that&apos;s how you want to do it? Let&apos;s go to plan B!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_08_02">OK, I got you a new plan but you need to be quick. Mr Blonde, did you bring the freezer juice?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_27_01">Yes, sir, will do. Thank you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_21_03">Get the safes loaded onto that truck!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_85_01">Ah, that&apos;s what we came for. Nice and shiny. Take it and and keep it safe!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_06_any_01">Alright, locate the server room, and get inside, there&apos;s no point in disabling the alarms now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_77_01">Can&apos;t drop the equipment until you arrange the smoke!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_03_02">Ah, kak. The place has gone into lockdown.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_64_02">What are you doing?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_118_01">OK, I&apos;m in. Give me a little time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_17_02">Nice. That cuts their options. Exploit that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_11_any_02">Take a look around - Vlad&apos;s tiara has to be in there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_45_03">The winch! Take the chain and get it on the teller booth!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_30_01">Good call. If you get it back in one piece, it will fetch a pretty penny, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_14_01">We don&apos;t have time to load and unload the safes. The chopper&apos;s just going to carry the truck. It can do it. You just need to get in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_01_02">Don&apos;t let them close, gang!</string>
	 <string id="rb22_bph_intro_04aa">I kind of have a bad feeling about this. Should I have a bad feeling about this?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_21">...I&apos;m 91% sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_75_02">SWAT have sent a heavy truck. They&apos;re taking this seriously. Knuckle down.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_01_02">Right, friends, let&apos;s keep our hostage out of trouble and safe, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_74_03">We need to track down the guest with the keycard. Probably pumping nickels into the slots.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_39_01">Kerels have stopped the drill. You gotta restart it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_68_08">Brilliant! Set the computer back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_70_02">Bank robbers win!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_43_02">Great. Now place that C4 and we can start getting out of this place.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_04_06">Yeah, come on in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_28_05">Counter-clockwise friends. That&apos;s how you remove a screw. Most of the time.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_14_02">OK, friends. I&apos;ve got Twitch standing by to come get you. Let me give him the go-ahead. Hang on for a bit, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_21_02">Guys, the EMP will most likely take out our communication when it goes off. But you know what to do, enter the laboratory via the hatch and look for the test subjects.</string>
	 <string id="csm_cs1_03_01">Yeah, there&apos;s a charge on my credit card the wife can&apos;t see. I was in Mexico and...</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_25_02">Look in all the sanctum rooms if you haven&apos;t found everything you need.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_170_03">You gotta grab the parts of the winch, crew!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_74_02">I&apos;ve got Twitch waiting for you in the basement. Take the elevator, and don&apos;t forget the box!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_04_any_02">Looks like we hit the spot. Those are the guns we are after.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_34_04">The second box, friends. Find it in the mainframe.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_10_01">More enemies! I&apos;d appreciate some help...</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap06_02">An old saying in Ukraine is 150 years for every sin, then you burn forever.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_52_01">That&apos;s a proper jailbreak, my friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_16_01">Power&apos;s down! Get that goat!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_59_01">Okay, patience now, my friends. Each vault has a short timelock. You know, for security.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_36_03">Get the water hose connected to the safe!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_60_03">One of you guys pick up the phone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_brf_b_01">That truck you assholes tagged wasn&apos;t the right one, so we can forget about intercepting those voting machines. We&apos;re going to try something else to keep the Elephant sweet. We can trigger a re-election by scrambling the server at the polling place. To avoid suspicion on our sponsor, we&apos;ll make it look like collateral damage by robbing the bank next door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_51_01">Nicely done, now see about getting access to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_09_02">Bain will make the call.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_72_01">Great, now start the money maker.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_43_01">The alarm has activated a second feature on the gate - a magnetic seal. Drill can&apos;t touch that, so you need to access a terminal to release it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_72_02">Well done, friends. Only thing left is to zip it out of there.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_12_any_01">Load the bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_24_01">Go check the Velvet Room for a laptop. Just don&apos;t stick to the walls.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap03_02">That shit you pulled with my relative. You&apos;re going to regret it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_53_03">Typical. Just what we need, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_15_01">There&apos;s the main gate. Could be watched. Maybe find another way in?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_16_02">I think there&apos;s a PC in the fitness center.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_04_03">There must a way to get beyond the fence. Check it out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_65_02">Try to find something highly flammable to light this up with!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_36_02">Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Time to drop that skyhook cage. Over.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_77_01">Good, now keep those dwankies away from the pump!</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_10_03">He bought it. The time has come to kill Mr. Sosa. Give him my regards.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_65_01">You gotta find that plane. </string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_02_02">We&apos;re not going in by the main entrance. You see that fence? That&apos;s our way in. Put on your mask and cut it open.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_22_01">I, I don&apos;t understand, why don&apos;t you just hack the computers?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_end_b_03">No cop could have seen  this one coming. Perfect. The Russians are going to be pissed and Vlad will OD on vodka. After we get paid. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_68_03">Nice job, contact resumed.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_20_03">Nice. That should help. And speaking of help, so would lighting a flare. You get my hint, friends?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_08_any_03">Great, you got some. Let&apos;s check this later.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_14_01">What&apos;s that? A blueprint?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_160_01">This is, uh, Craig in the, uh, Customer Satisfaction Department calling.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_54_01">Pump&apos;s done! Vault is full and ready for blasting!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_87_01">You gotta protect the Beast!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_70_03">Ok, now make your way to the vault, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_62_any_01">That&apos;s it! I can&apos;t stay any longer!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_16_01">Now find a terminal in IT with internet access. Upload that data to me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_end_a_12">If there were more crews like you I think the world would need to store its valuables elsewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_11_02">A goat in a fan? This day gets weirder. Find the circuit box to halt the fan.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_31_01">Have you found the garage yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_06_02">Look around for crowbars in the warehouse. Stick them into the vault&apos;s fans, and wait for thermodynamics to do the rest.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_13_07">It&apos;s like a needle in a thousand stacks of hay, but you need to find the crate! Get to the tech lab.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_10_02">Oh, that safe looks like it could hold some etra loot for us. Get it open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_10secs_to_departure">Ten seconds! Move! Move! Move!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_32_any_16">Nice! 20!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_58_02">That&apos;s it! Great job, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_34_01">Watch it guys, it&apos;s crumbling!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_91_02">Any luck with finding the garage?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_32_01">Grab those bags and get them to the vault. Might be a good idea to take some spares too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_09_03">The van has to split. I&apos;m sending Bile in the chopper right now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_70_01">Great job, gang. The escape van is ready for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_14_01">SWATS on the roof! Looks like they won&apos;t give up that easily!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_14_03">It&apos;s open! Get the stuff out of the deposit boxes!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_76_02">Hack the door to get it open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_15_01">Hell yeah! That was crazy, gang! Now get in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_18_03">Thirty sec, guys! Hurry the hell up!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_33_any_02">Only one left now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_49_02">He didn&apos;t pick up the server.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_09_any_02">Bags to the car people.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_108_02">See if you can find a clue to where the entrance is. They wouldn&apos;t make it obvious.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_13_03">Don&apos;t forget those stones, get them to Blonde!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_10">It&apos;s the cops! They&apos;re following us!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_36_04">Come on friends, get to the archaeology wing.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_02_02">They would probably want easy access to the tunnel, so check around outside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_11_03">Don&apos;t make a fuss though, you&apos;ll get discovered.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_14_02">Christ, a lot of office gossip, but no codes. Next.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_10_03">There&apos;s more of them! If you don&apos;t mind - some help please?</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_11_01b">Rust&apos;s gonna kill me if I miss the sexy details, so I need you to grab a beautiful chrome skull from inside the clubhouse. I don&apos;t do things half-assed, and we want the best for this baby.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_end_b_01">You can dance, I will give you that. Good work. Get the money here and let&apos;s talk with Vlad.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_11_any_02">That&apos;s one. Get the next!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_05_any_01">That&apos;s everything, wait for their call.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_71_06">Watch those sprinklers!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_13_01b">They are all over the main entrance. We can&apos;t get out that way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_18_03">That gate will take you into the more guarded areas of the bank.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_18_04">Get the timer going again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_run_01_02">I&apos;ve got a driver standing by. Eddie, that&apos;s your cue, get in there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_14_01">Good, now get to a workstation and override it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_24_02">There should be another wheel around here somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_24_01">Time to start looking for that stash of Murky loot. We&apos;re looking for cash, and lots of it. </string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_intro_02_02">The Gensec trucks just turned into our guy&apos;s sight. Wait for it... Wait for it...</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_12_02">OK, friends, now remove that saw.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_99_02">The gun is ready to go, mash the fire button and enjoy the show.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_58_03">Place the missiles by the radar and activate them. That should do the trick.</string>
	 <string id="sys_hb2_05_03">Welcome back, Director Stevens.</string>
	 <string id="rb22_sah_intro_01a">More like we&apos;re heisting an HP Lovecraft novel...</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_40k_01">Use the blowtorch to open the gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_24_any_05">It needs hydrogen chloride - for sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_104_02">Three colored numbers. Look for computer briefcases.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_22_03">Start searching for that Murkywater nest egg. It&apos;s in the form of weapons.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_02_01">Use whatever you got to open that sucker up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_08_02">Have you looked upstairs for the office?</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_brief_02">Alright. Scanning equipment is in position on the rooftop. Sneak in, take his mobile phone, laptop, hard drives, and tablet pc. Anything technical. Then bring it to the roof.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_08_01">The van&apos;s coming in. Get the bags ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_14_any_01">Holy shit! They&apos;ve got mines hooked up to the camera system!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_cro_04_01">I&apos;ve never seen shooting like that. Four shots, and four transports are taken out. Make it count.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_21_02">Turn off the flow of coolant. That should make the secondary servers overheat.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_32_01">And I believe that about does it, my friends! Now, please ensure that our hard-earned loot is placed on the cables and conveyed up to me. </string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_intro_a_01">The FBI is onto us! Guns up! Don&apos;t lose that coke!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_103_02">Guys, I have to pull the chopper out until things cool down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_15_01">Fuel receipts, insurance claims. Nothing useful here. Keep checking the terminals.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_08_01">My accomplice will assist you. He&apos;s waiting.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_39_05">Get the drill going again, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_28_any_01">This isn&apos;t a war folks, in and out.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_11_03">Die motherfuckers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_29_01">That was crazy guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_32_05">Mercy Hospital, what do you want?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_40_01">Are you looking for explosive ingredients?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_20_01">Ok, I&apos;m dialing now. Stay low and wait.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_94_02">The car keys should be around there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_15_02">Maybe if you cut the power nearby, he&apos;ll come investigate what&apos;s going on, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_16">Fuck me sideways!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_07_01">OK, now you gotta get into the control room. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_02_02">Security looks pretty tight at the front. Maybe look for other ways in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_16_any_02">OK..OK.. Just need to get the server out of its housing and walk it to the van.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_68_03">Start searching for the Murkywater nest egg we&apos;re after. It&apos;s in the form of cocaine.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_02_01">Hmm, the entrance looks secured. I suggest you try to find another way in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_72_03">You gotta get inside, quickly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_49_any_04">Snipers are here. We can&apos;t stick around!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_23_02">That&apos;s it! They just flushed the final bag down the shitter. Give me a minute, I gotta mentally process what just happened...</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_03_any_03">This seems fishy but I don&apos;t know - get the paintings on the table and keep your spider sense tingling.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_02_02b">Sweet Jesus . . . Why does this happen to me? What did I ever do to upset these shitbags? I was only here to get Rust&apos;s bike...</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_32_02">Friends, Vlad here is getting a bit impatient...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_01b_01">Now search the boat, but be careful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_47_03">Finally, get him out now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_06_02">What&apos;s he thinking?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_15_03">The main gate is the quickest way in, but probably watched. Maybe other ways in?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_72_02">You got to fetch some gas and torch those cars.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_12_01">Remember, you&apos;ll have to pay for these kinds of &quot;special&quot; favors in the future. My contacts don&apos;t work for free.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_10d_02">Nice work! The tenth wave was beaten back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_44_03">We could have used that guy. Ah well. Switch to the back up plan.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_05_03">That&apos;s it. Great! Now return it to Hoxton.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_39_02">Only one minute to go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_18_04">Still gotta get your hands on the card.</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_08_01">You should help the Captain, gang. Take that saw and put it to use on the door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_39_02">Well, we&apos;re not getting the van down any time soon, so blast the doors.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_116_01">You got one minute til that Captain raises the alarm.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_76_04">You need to hack this door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_20_01">*whistles* There it is. What a beauty.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_17_any_06">We&apos;re going to make some money now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_31_03">And... In! Great. Now keep the connection secure. Going as fast as can.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_65_01">They&apos;re the keys for the doors inside the vault. Good find.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_12_01">Find the code. Did you check the whole room?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_29_01">The staircase is blocked off! There must be a way up nearby!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_38_02">Maybe he put it somewhere really obvious, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_41_01">No time to sit around, you gotta go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_51_01">The thermite has melted a hole straight into the vault, just as planned. Jump down and grab the cash!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_overpass_sniper_on_rooftop_01">A sniper is moving in to deploy on a rooftop on the other side of the highway. Don&apos;t let him stop you.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_16_03">What a messy situation. Let&apos;s get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_22_03">OK, he&apos;s off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_02_03">We need the mechanic&apos;s help to put together Rust&apos;s bike. Follow his lead.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_101_03">You gotta get the drill running again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_32_01">There he is!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_11_02">The safe is open. See what was inside!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_78_01">Chopper coming in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_52_03">That&apos;s how it&apos;s done! Now, grab the stuff!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_04_03">Two time locks... hmmm. OK, we&apos;ll need keycards to bypass them. Security here is too low-level to have those, so focus on the civilian researchers. Pretty sure a few of them are carrying keycards.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_91_01">Nine</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_43_03">Sounds like the cops are about to bust through to Wilson&apos;s house!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_16_03">Come on, please, join the party inside!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_01d_01">You&apos;ve defeated the first wave of cops!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_48_02">Lost power friends, you need to get it back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_25_any_03">It&apos;s rock&apos;n&apos;roll-time!</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_end_02">He&apos;s back and already cleaning out my drinks cabinet. Korva. Anyway, you boys did good. You earned this.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_76_04">Kerels are still going after the weapon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_93_01">Mr. big-shot CFO had to go bye-bye. At least he had the priviledge of seeing my face before he went!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_59_03">The drill has stopped!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_80_02">Go back into the mainframe and locate the second box, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="rb1_bph_intro_02f">Time for a little comeuppance. </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_74_02">You need to find the emergency power lever friends.</string>
	 <string id="csf_cs1_01_02">Yeah, how much money do I got in there? How much?</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_22_01">Move up to the overpass and keep going uphill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_44_02">Okay, see that terminal I marked. Get over there, hack in and let&apos;s kill that magnetic seal.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_06_any_02">C&apos;mon, move it get into the house.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_11_02">That sure showed them not to mess with you. Now, grab the coke and return to the van. Time to get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_end_stealth_01">Nice job, sneaking Vlad&apos;s dwankie brother-in-law out of there. Maybe he will stay out of trouble in the future, yeah? (Heh.. not likely...)</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_54_01">Nice, friends. Thank you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_can_04_02">You see the chimney there? That&apos;s where Vlad needs those &quot;presents&quot;.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_38_03">Try the locker room for uniforms!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_100_02">Now just grab that thing and get it out of there. It&apos;s what we came for.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_14_02">The vault&apos;s open. Time to see what&apos;s inside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_68_06">That cannon&apos;s not going to fire without some juice.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_51_02">You managed to unlock the outer panic room door, so the lance shouldn&apos;t take as long!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_72_02">And they still don&apos;t know you&apos;re there. Keep it that way while the Moretta docks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_08_01">There&apos;s another guard. Stay out of sight.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_19_02">The doors should open once the ECM jammer stops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_46_02">We need a crowbar, look around.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_03_02">The trains belonging to Murkywater should be easy to spot. Find them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_01_any_01">OK folks, only way out of there is through those doors. </string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_31_04">Go to that pillar! Move!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_lst_01">Ok, that&apos;s the last of them. Now we need to make sure no one knows what happened here. I&apos;m gonna make a call, hang on, guys...</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_30_02">Stealing a man&apos;s car after killing him is the ultimate insult. I like it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_25_02">You did good, Dallas. Now, get to the van and get out of there. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_54_01">Excellent, you got the explosives. Now, plant them on the radar.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_129_01">I got access to the vault. Opening shortly...</string>
	 <string id="plt_run_08_03">Get over here, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_10_any_01">Almost enough.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_33_any_01">Find his server room and get in there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_01_04">Hello, friends. You&apos;re almost at the drop point I have selected, so, if you would emerge and, as you say, get the party started.</string>
	 <string id="sys_hb2_07_01">Armory access granted.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_18_01">See that open window? As long as things stay quiet you can secure loot by tossing it out there. A contact will pick it up for us.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_31_01">Listen my friends... I&apos;ve been thinking... that&apos;s a very nice Christmas tree. I think I&apos;ll take it. I will send the helicopter to pick it up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_03_03">The voting results are stored on a nearby server. Find it and scramble that data.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_22_01">Turn off the valves at the bottom of the server rack.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_54_01">Hit him!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_57_02">There, now put that nasty stuff to work on the door.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_20_04">Answer the Intercom, son!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_91_01">Look around the West Wing for something strong to use on the barrier!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_03_02">There should be four prison transports.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_09_02">You got it. The Diamond. The goddamn Diamond.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_45_01">Damn, the retinal scanner means we needed the boss alive. Now, we&apos;ll have to do it loud.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_25_02">Hmm, I&apos;m not familiar with that design. Must be very unusual. Have a look in the nearby utility rooms and see of you can find a schematic.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_50_03">You see all those crates? They&apos;re about to get shipped out directly to the Commissar&apos;s location. Grab the labels and check them at the reader over there. That should give us Commissar&apos;s precise location.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_02_03">We&apos;ve got cops on the way, so don&apos;t dawdle. Find the C4! Check the guard room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_33_02">Damn! You&apos;ve got to raise the balloon again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_32_01">Console on the right!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_53_01">That&apos;s what we&apos;re here for, friends. Huh.. same kind of writing that Lindenhurst decrypted...</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_06_02">Coming back for another one. Let&apos;s drop this one on the house, ok?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_28_01">You can only open one vault at a time, and I should make you aware that not all vaults contain loot. How you figure out which to open is your problem.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_03_01">And don&apos;t get too close to the Murkys. You may be wearing their uniforms, but these guys are their top agents and know their own.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_13_any_01">OK, I have access...</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_11_02">Guys, you need to get the hell out of there, and you need to do it fast. SWATS are gonna swarm the place and this is your only chance to get out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_30_02">Time to split! To the right and down the stairs. Go!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_07_any_03">I&apos;ll deliver this and then come back for more!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_52_01">That&apos;s it! We got the Commissar&apos;s location. Time to haul ass. Those crates gave me an idea...</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_48_01">Ach, kek! I&apos;ve lost the connection. Turn the power back on, for me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_33_any_03">Ah OK... So, seems to be a bit too many of them here. Fusion Engines that is. Find the correct one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_74_03">All right, Bile is en-route. He&apos;ll ferry that counterfeit cash away.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_70_01">Take the box back to the skylight where you came in, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_89_02">Gang, don&apos;t forget to crack those containers. Drill &apos;em!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_78_03">I found something for you to use.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_38_02">Connect the garden hose to the safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_intro_a_01">You&apos;re almost at the gallery. Slip in, avoid cameras, guards, and motion detectors. Security&apos;s high because of a bomb threat.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_53_03">You need to get that hose reconnected, guys. Come on!</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_27_01b">Ugh, Why is it taking so long?</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_11_any_02">That&apos;s enough for Vlad, but get more if you feel brave.</string>
	 <string id="plt_as1_04_01">Okay. I see the flare. Starting descent.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_85_03">The shutdown has been aborted. You need to get back to the control box and restart it, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_12">I didn&apos;t like that poephol&apos;s manners.</string>
	 <string id="plt_flt_05_01">Balcony. The C4 is on the balcony. I missed the roof. Sorry &apos;bout that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_fal_01">I&apos;m disappointed in you, guys. You can&apos;t even defend your own home.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_05_01">Damn! The time locks are locked down. Keycard&apos;s aren&apos;t worth crap now. Time to brute force the security panels!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_15_03">Haul that beautiful gold out to container 61. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_13_06">Activate the sprinklers. You got to put out the fires.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_03_03">The snipers have me pinned down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_13_02">Second half of the database is on the way. Once we have it, I should be able to pinpoint the destination of the truck with the voting machines.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_25_03">That&apos;s not how we do it! Never let them take you. This job is over.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_82_03">C&apos;mon, you gotta have a good look around for something to use.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_cnc_03_01">We&apos;re intercepting Gensec trucks about to unload at the docks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_12_01">Looks like they hired a new IT specialist. See if you can find any clues in the manager&apos;s office about him, then hack his computer. Once in, I&apos;ll get the lock open for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_03_01">Ditch the charges at the door, guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_10_04">Get that tag to the computer. Chop chop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_intro_01_01">If you got shares in First World Bank, sell. &apos;Cos they&apos;re about to suffer a hostile takeover. Let&apos;s do it.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_02_03">Can&apos;t move forward. What do we do?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_82_01">Remember where that ladder is, gang. You can access the roof there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_13_03">That goat has live current running through it! Disable the power!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_34_02">Good, that should be the code. Make a note of it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_25_03">The truck is coming up. Just hit the gas and drive into it!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_30_02">Make the tree come alive, with snow!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_09_02">You&apos;ll have to force your way through the bars. Is there anything around there you can use?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_36_07">Find and deal with the manager, crew. Gotta get that keycard!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_42_01">I&apos;ve arranged a false pager for a first-year resident, but first you need to get hold of a patient file.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_25_03">I would have hid it in the safe too. But I&apos;m a cynical man.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_04_03">Hurry up you chops. Use the thermite and get inside those walls.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_36_01">Ok, it&apos;s time to go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_17_01">Not a single bag?! This is a nightmare!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_03_04">Come on. Get inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_02_01">Case the place, guys. Find the bank, and find the polling place. Then get them both.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_05_01">Great work! The vault should be exposed now. You know the drill.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_13_02">Maybe look for Buluc&apos;s body guards&apos; names written on something.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_03a_any_02">I&apos;ll be there in four...</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_chopper_arrived_01">The chopper&apos;s here! Watch out for snipers when you&apos;re moving the loot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_58_03">Now get the cable on both the pick-up and the hatch.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_06_any_01">You have ten seconds to get to the van.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_01_any_01">Let&apos;s get the bags secured ASAP. There&apos;s a boat on the way to pick them up.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_04_02a">And people are starting to talk and wonder what the hell is going on.$NL;</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_18_any_01">Thanks, I&apos;ll have my man here inspect it and if it&apos;s the right one we&apos;re good to go. So hang tight for a second.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_22_02">Hmm. Maybe there&apos;s a better way in than via security.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_17_01">If you call in the chopper, things are gonna go loud. Don&apos;t do it until you&apos;re ready.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_10_02">Move quickly, friends. No time to waste.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_07_03">The longer you take, the more difficult this is going to become.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_59_02">Achh! That vehicle has got to be removed!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_74_03">OK, friends. Time to put some fuel in that plane.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_100_02">Whose bright idea was it to set up a methlab in an unventilated tin box?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_18_02">You see the open window there? If thing&apos;s ain&apos;t loud, you can secure loot through there. Got a contact ready to collect.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_33_03">Second color and number? Great!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_70_01">Now, validate that blood sample.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_22_01">Ok, the plane is coming in soon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_37_02">Now load up on C4. You&apos;ll need it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_01_to_departure_heli">Hurry up! It&apos;s just one minute until take off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_brief_01">A little bird told me the Mendozas are flying in more weapons in preparation for the war with Hector. We go to their airport, find the weapons and take them all or destroy them.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_54b_any_05">... over-delivering! Way to go! Hector likes that shit!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_59_05">Just hold on to your horses, friends. The vault will be open any second. </string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_32_03">You&apos;re reading my mind. We&apos;re going to need that gas later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_65_02">Those keys will open the doors in the vault. That should help.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_30_03">The server room is in security lockdown. We can&apos;t access it now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_01_01">Get those masks on, gang.</string>
	 <string id="hnc_man_01_01">You got the data, Mr. Sturr?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_06_02">Be quick now. It&apos;s got two code locks. You need code breakers on both. And stay hidden!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_01_to_arrival_heli">The chopper is one minute away.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_17_01">The Oval Office is close. The keycard you need to enter the PEOC should be there.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_21_any_05">That&apos;s nine bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_pkp_02_01">Throw the bags into the back of the pick-up truck. He&apos;s right below the right window.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_46_03">You&apos;re in the open. Problems will be on the way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_55_01">All right, now let the winch do its job.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_67_01">Look what the badger dragged out of the bushes! Almost thought he wasn&apos;t going to show! You car is here, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_39_03">Get to the escape! HURRY!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_58_01">You might have to check the upper floor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_28_03">A door breaker! Couldn&apos;t have wished for anything better!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_39_07">Great. Now bring on the waterworks!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_31_02">The Dentist just clued me in - the Commissar likes to keep his best loot in the basement. Look around the ground floor rooms for something that might be an entrance.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_09_09">Now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_intro_05_01">OK, Gensec is approaching. Gun that engine. Move! Move!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_44_03">YES FRIENDS! Oh, sorry... I&apos;m not used to this sneaking about, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_48a_03">Let&apos;s give Mr Blonde a diversion. Make a break for it over by the Big John&apos;s Burger Joint so the cops will follow you and not Mr. Blonde and the loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_02_03">Your next target is the voting machines. I&apos;ll bet they&apos;re stored in sealed crates. You clowns will need to improvise to open them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_32_01">Get a drill onto the safe, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_40_06">Might want to pick up the pace gang.The keycard and code are all you need.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_125_02">One!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_01_02">...Kerels are on route in squad cars, so don&apos;t dawdle, and keep those civvies out of your way, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_20_02">Now while the time lock counts down, you can get ahead of the action. There&apos;s a zip-line on the roof that will need setting up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_25_01">Have you looked in the entire sanctum? There&apos;s a library, a lounge and even a meeting room. Buluc has thought of everything, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_10_02">Come on, go to the computer.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_04a_01">Dwankie chop! I would like to kick his teeth in.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_06b_any_04">... make sure you&apos;re ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_30_01">That&apos;s the exit! Just a few more steps to clean clothes and hot baths.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_48_01">More leather dwankies! Take care of them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_86_01">C&apos;mon, grab the dinges!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_intro_01_01">Security here is tight. We might be able to do this heist silently. But if things go loud, don&apos;t worry. I&apos;ve always got a Plan B.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_13_03">Are you nuts, Vlad? These are live nukes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_19_01">That console panel should control all the cameras in the building. Use it and see if you can locate the computer that way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_40_01">Can&apos;t be 100%, but I think that&apos;s right.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_76_05">You almost gotta feel sorry for the Commissioner after a night like this. Almost.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_10_02">Into the mansion! Hustle!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_15_any_03">SWATs on the scene... Here we go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_65_04">Still waiting on those routers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_run_04_01">I&apos;ve got your airborne friend Bile coming in to lift you out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_21_02">I can see that Ernesto Sosa likes to collect paintings. We&apos;ll burn them all, that should make him angry. Gather them in a pile.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_15_any_01">The van will be there in a couple of minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_04">...I think so, at least.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_19_02">Gang, you need to grab the car keys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_36_02">Taking a bit of time, isn&apos;t it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_14_03">There should be clues around to help you figure out the truck. Get Sherlocking. Look for open containers, they might indicate what the trucks are carrying.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_24_03">The Mayan dinges is probably opened with that codex. Just need to find the right symbols. Have a search nearby and see what you can find.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_end_a_02">Well, no fusion, but at least we get to drive gas-guzzling cars a lot longer this way. I love my Firebird as much as the next man.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_04_01">Come on, find that second truck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_103_03">Stand by guys, the chopper has to do a little detour until things calm down.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_42_02">Well, looks like we have some crafty litte thieves, trying to steal our money. Put them down.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_09_any_02">I&apos;m heading off to unload these - but I&apos;m coming back, hold on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_34a_01">You&apos;ll need some kind of tool to cut him loose.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_57_01">Keep looking! You&apos;ve got to find that evidence!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_05_01">Alright, chopper&apos;s here. Bring the pilot to it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_16_01">Got it! I&apos;m in the system. While I finish this, get out to the van and grab the C4. Plant it in the street.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_37_02">...bolts need to go into the floor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_129_03">OK, time to open the vault...</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_25_03">Really, Bile? I might have expected that from Alex, but not you... Anyhow, gang, go pick up the C4 and plant it around the floors right above the panic room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_79_01">What are you waiting for? The vault is open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_08_04">Did you find the key tag yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_35_01">This thing has secrets that can topple the government. Wanna see what the President keeps in a folder called &quot;Gentlemen&apos;s Interests&quot;? Yeah, you do - for sure!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_03_03">You heard the man. Let&apos;s find those trucks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_21_03">There&apos;s an override switch in the security office. It closes the bank&apos;s shutters. That&apos;s gonna help you keep the feds out of the bank.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_16_01">All right, first things first: set up the saws.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_57_01">OK, looks like a proper cocktail, now get that stuff on the door and let it work, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_46_any_02">Keep the cops off the circuit breakers if you want to make it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_dfb_02">Don&apos;t let them take your money bags!</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_02_05">Ain&apos;t no bailin&apos; on this one. We&apos;re finishing what Bain started.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_66_01">Okay, you can only zipline up two at a time. And there&apos;s no going back down, friends. </string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_07_03">While I&apos;m doing this, you should go ahead and find those three laptops with the code fragments.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_intro_01_03">It&apos;s quiet out there tonight. Keep it that way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_03_04">Wasn&apos;t this one. Keep going. Vault is here somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_25_01">OK. Give me a minute or so.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_16_any_01">OK, I&apos;m coming in, get the server ready!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_07_02">That&apos;s the place, but you gotta get into the control room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_end_a_02b">Now it&apos;s our turn to finish the job and take his place down. See you at the safe house.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cr3_01_02">You ready for it? I&apos;m dropping the hose.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_09_any_02">Good, now we need at least 3 more just like this and you need to get them to the van. It&apos;s in the parking lot next to the gallery.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_08b_any_04">Be quick now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_14_02">Chopper&apos;s headed for the lumber yard - be there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_05_03">Stand by, crew. I got a batch of ingredients on their way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_21_04">How&apos;s that door coming along?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_intro_01_06">Park up here. Alright. There it is. Let&apos;s do this.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_07_04b">Oh, shit! </string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_47_03">A little while longer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_intro_a_01b">You&apos;re gonna go in through the fence, find the guns and bring &apos;em back here. They&apos;re not going down without a fight. If it hits the fan out there - destroy the guns.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_04_02">Alright, nobody stay underground.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_05_02">Now, get those trucks opened. Let&apos;s get inside them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_23_01">Blerrie, they took the hostage out from under your noses! We&apos;ve messed this one up good!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_06_01">Excellent, you got in. The EMP parts should be there somewhere. Find it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_101_04">C&apos;mon friends, the drill has been stopped!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_cbf_01_01">Gensec have a brand new vault - the Investment Safe. Unbreakable, they say, and they&apos;re showcasing it at the arena. The door is made of their new compound - Vivinite. But everything has a soft spot. With a bit of C4 and a new circular cutter, we can steal their cash out right from beneath them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_07_01">That&apos;s the first machine hacked. Make sure you close up that crate. Don&apos;t want anyone getting suspicious.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_02_01">Before we begin, I&apos;ve arranged for a few small articles to be left for you. Find the crates with the red strobe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_06_any_02">Keycard to somewhere in on the next location. Sweet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_93_01">The Grin&apos;s vault can only be opened with a three digit code. This is one of the numbers we&apos;ll need to open it. Make a note.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_23_02">Just missed it. Try again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_39_02">Try not killing anyone, but if it has to be done, then hiding the body under the train should be safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_16_any_01">1600 Penn, maybe we go there for our next big score.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_73_02">Don&apos;t go down while carrying blood samples guys, they&apos;re likely to break.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_12_01">The code is split onto three laptops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_end_a_01">OK the intel is good. It&apos;ll help us plan the attack on the big villa that the scientist seems to be hiding in. Let&apos;s saddle up and go there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_37_03">Keep looking. Pull out the books if you have to.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_24_01">Something&apos;s up with the elevator... Wait... Give me a moment.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_32_03">That&apos;s it. Now we just need some more on the fourth and fifth floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_12_04">Keep going guys, we&apos;re still undetected.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_18_02">You guys need to shut that alarm down. Find the button, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_84_04">Are you having problems?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_84_02">It&apos;s finished. You should be able to get through the gate, now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_18">Right in the bradley, yeah.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_06_01">Can&apos;t find the laptop? Check around the house - the garage maybe?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_09_01">Now go to the computer so we can code that key tag for access!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_21_03">Did you find the cell block?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_13_01">Damn. The panic room has more reinforcment than I expected. State Department didnt cut corners. We&apos;re gonna need a thermal lance. I&apos;ll call in Bile.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_18_03">It&apos;s a bare bones haul, but it&apos;ll do. Better luck next year, crew.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_05_any_01">That&apos;s the door, but don&apos;t open it yet. We need to disable the alarm, hold on a second...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_13">They&apos;re dumping that coke like the mean it! Get up there and stop them!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_28_02">I left a case of thermal paste for you down there. Make sure you grab it. </string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_02_02">First stop is the Operations Room. It&apos;s the Feds&apos; nerve centre. Should be able to find what we need there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_14_02">Now boost that gold to the readied container in the yard. Number 61!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_09_03">Woah, we lost some loot in that explosion! Well, no time to waste! Look trough the rest of the deposit boxes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_09_01">Did I speak in Afrikaans? My apologies! I meant to say &quot;please&quot; &quot;plant&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;charges&quot; &quot;on the locks&quot;... you kaks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_79_02">Away from the gate! Hustle it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_113_01">You guys got lucky. The vault&apos;s already open!</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_02_10">We really doin&apos; this? We&apos;re really doin&apos; this!</string>
	 <string id="hnc_man_01_03">Did you bring the data, Mr. Sturr?</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_21_01">Charon? Are you ok?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_107_02">Don&apos;t miss that chopper now!</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cs1_07_01">60 seconds to target. Over.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_02_01">Two minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_cafe_30secs_to_arrival_subway_01">The subway entrance will be open in 30 seconds, just hold on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_06_03">Great job - it&apos;s got all the info on where the money&apos;s hidden.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_02_any_01">That&apos;s the server room, get inside and hook me up to the computer.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_25_02">I&apos;ll carry Bain to the copper if you just keep those Murky chops off us!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_11_02">That&apos;s the code! Great. Now get it working on that time lock.</string>
	 <string id="elp_election_brf_speak_03">Help the citizens of DC to vote right. We need to find the ballot machines in the harbor and intercept them before they get deployed. The machines must swing votes to me!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_28_02">He&apos;s got turrets too! Watch it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_intro_01b">Quickly now, friends. In and out like mousey ghosts, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_39_09">Don&apos;t shoot the Christmas tree!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_11_01">Just keep hacking those machines. The more shit we fling at Schwartz, the more will stick.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_19_any_01">Too many people in there. Watch the civilians or this will get ugly fast.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_16_any_03">They&apos;re breaching the wall!</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_11_01">Look out, tear gas!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_69_01">You need to get the power back up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_51_01">OK, that&apos;s the Petersson file. They got him isolated in the ICU and you gotta get to him. Time to play doctor, guys.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_06_06">Remember guys, the payoff on this one is important.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_07_07">More snipers incoming! Watch out!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_33_01">Ok, we need to lift this little baby out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_154_02">Uh, it was number...</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_04_01">Look around for hose line and tank of diesel.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_83_02">Deposit boxes! Start breaking them, gang. One bag is minimum, but take as much as you can.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_05_03">Hey guys - did you see the splash it made?</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_18_03">They shot me, but it&apos;s only a minor one. Barely hurts.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_73_01">Careful guys. If you go down carrying one of those things, you might break it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_37_03">Great, guys! Now you can grab some more loot or take the escape, the choice is yours.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_04a_02">Open those doors, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_37_01">Drill baby, drill!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_36_01">Even diamond bits break! You&apos;re gonna need the spare parts to get it going again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_50_02">And now, if you would be so kind, the loot bags to the helicopter? Please?</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_04_03">Be there in under a minute.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_brief_02b">Make sure we get the paintings.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_60_04">Go start the drill!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_11_02">People will pay fortunes for this ancient Babylonian shit.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_12_03">Let&apos;s fuckin&apos; blow this pop stand.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_84_03">The gate should be open for you now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_62_02">Uh-oh, looks like Commissar&apos;s chopper is back for another bite.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_67_02">Good! Defend your campfire until it&apos;s all gone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_14_03">Credit applications. Accepted! No codes though. Next one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_29_02">That will look great in the safehouse if we can ever make room for it. Take it with you. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_g_03">That should&apos;a been muriatic acid!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_26_01">Pick up the C4 and then plant it on the floor right above the panic room.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_03_03">You are worse than pond scum! I will silence you forever for this!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_54b_02">No... no...there will be no leg-cutting here right now, got that?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_20_any_01">Add muriatic acid, to continue the process!</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt2_04_03">What a great way to start the year. With a mountain of fucking coke to move! Congratulations, dear friends. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_41_02">Wrong code, friends. Wait until it resets, then have another go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_29_any_03">I lost connection, I need you to get the power back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_22_01">It&apos;ll just be one one minute.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_26e_01">That&apos;s just what I needed!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_21_03">Can&apos;t believe what a domkop he is.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_71_03">That&apos;s the callback, it&apos;s seems to have worked. When the timer hits zero - we get rich boys and girls.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_07">...for sure. Or, most likely.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_09_any_01">Find some cover!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_21_01">Thermite&apos;s done. We can use water pump nearby to fill the wagons. Connect that hose to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_02_03">Can&apos;t do much until you get inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_07_02">Come on, crew. Get the safes out. Put your back into it.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_07">Keep bringing goats!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_13_01">Search the manager&apos;s office to see who this new IT guy is. Then locate his computer, and hack it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_18_02">Maybe some of those workers have a keycard for the railcars.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_15_02">Reboot the hack. And keep the cops off it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_06_01">The damn scrambler just went down again. Get it fixed!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_04_06">Don&apos;t hold back! Give him a good smack!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_21_02">Pinky Demon schnapps? Huh. Find it, spike it, serve it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_09_01">That terminal is showing which truck is going where. Keep checking. It might help pinpoint our truck.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_45_02">Almost here. Hurry! You beautiful bastards!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_68_03">A bit off my game today friends. Missed the software firewall backup. Can you find the correct computer and turn it off? </string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_06_02">The piece of shit just crashed again. Reboot the scrambler!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_end_b_02">Good work people. That was a hell of a thing to move, but it&apos;s the right engine and it&apos;s locked up tight. Maybe one day we&apos;ll go freelancing and take it back, huh?</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_17_03">Back office! Open the door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_96_03">They&apos;ve got every road out of there blocked. Time to go Vietcong on them. You&apos;ll see what I mean.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_03_01">That&apos;s keycard two. Good job, guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_31_01">That&apos;s a keycard alright. Take it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_47_02">Just one more keycard. Gotta be around here somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_55_03">Gensec suffered at your hands today, and doing it loud means the world knows it. This is good.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_01_02">Go Go Go! Cops will be here any minute!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_04_11">Soda. Caustic soda.I wouldn&apos;t mix a gin and tonic with it, though.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_47_01">Uh, sorry, this is my first day, what do you need?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_46_01">That&apos;s just... strange, eh?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_95_02">You gotta get those posh dwankies under control!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_24_03">Looks like the armory needs a special access level, you&apos;ll have to recode the key tag.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_03_02">Alright. First task: get on the other side of that fence.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_06_01">Bravo! Now, simply operate the officer&apos;s controls. It is a tier-7 job, monkey work, anyone can do it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_30_03">Hey, maybe that hatch hides something that can help us locate the Commissar. I got an idea how we can crack it. Bile is bringing you something. </string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_80_02">Something to open that door, remember!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_80_01">You&apos;re almost there, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_15_01">Don&apos;t look now, but...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_01_03">That&apos;s the Murky warehouse. All right, get at &apos;em!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_end_01_02">This is a historic day, gang. Haha, you finally cracked the Benevolent.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_35_any_04">It&apos;s a tiara, keep your eyes open. If it&apos;s not in the safe, it could be anywhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_12_02">Great. There it is. Disassemble it and then move the pieces out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_13_01">The alarm disabled the time lock. It&apos;s a setback but not a fail. There&apos;s a maintenance room on the roof. Get there. We should be able to reboot it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_10_03">Nice job, gang. Now start getting the goats in.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_04_01">Vlad is grateful you are doing this job. When this shit is over, and Buluc is dead, we get back to work for real, yes?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_69_03">Shame to see nice tech blow up like that. But fuck it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_39_02">Turn on that water hose!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_26_03">Shoot the gas can to set it on fire!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_27_03">So when you have your fill, I need you to drop the bags into this vent here. We&apos;ll pick &apos;em up later.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_01_any_02">This is the boat driver.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_62_01">Quickly now, get the power back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_25_02">Put him down in the chair and get the codes out of him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_30_01">That was some damn good sneaking, Dallas. I am impressed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_03_02">Your teammate is down! Help him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_13_any_02">Destroy the weapons or get them up to the van. Getting them to the van will get us more cash.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_29_02">Go put that door breaker to good use!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_35_01">Console on the right! And the left!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_39_02">One of the pallets hit the roof of the diner. I bet that had those Yanks shitting in their coffee, yeah. For sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_depositbox_stage1_intro_a_01b">The civilians might get ideas. Don&apos;t let &apos;em have &apos;em. See you at the safe house.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_02_06">Damn right we are. And if the fucking Dentist shows up, we&apos;re finishing him too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_39_03">Guys, we got all the money. You should get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_15_03">Listen up! The cops are bringing in a lot of people to block the tracks up ahead, so you really need to go. Bring the BCI tech and head back to Bile!</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_01_02">Come on, fingers out of assholes. The vault will be in a Murkywater container.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_64_02">You need to point the cannon right, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_05_any_01">Make sure no one else is there.</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_17_any_01">Thats everything, nice doing business with you gentlemen!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fourstores_stage1_brief_01">Look, I know Vlad is nuts. But he&apos;s got a lot of connections and I have a good feeling about him having a line on some big jobs down the line. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_66_03">The cops cut the power. We need to get it back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_11_any_01">One more, keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_17_01">It&apos;s done. Now hit the button, and lower the bollards.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_36_03">Sweet money, guys! Now make this worth it by grabbing as much loot as you can!</string>
	 <string id="pt2_cs1_01_02">Sure thing, boss. On my way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_30_03">Ok, time for the money, guys. We&apos;re gonna loot Ernesto&apos;s floor safe. Hook those winches up to the floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_requirement_05_bags">Remember guys, we need five bags to escape.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_12_01">Yeah, I brought it, so what now?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_02d_02">Nice work! The second wave was beaten back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_05_03">Go! Keep moving!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_29_01">Come on, gang. You&apos;ve gotta get the crane in position.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_20_any_02">Keep a low profile near the workers to be safe.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_04_08">Let&apos;s go with caustic soda. What could go wrong?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_23_03">Any second now. Does anybody know any jokes?</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_36_04">Time to escape!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_28_02">Use the manual to find which cable to cut, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_103_01">Careful, friends! They&apos;ve deployed tear gas!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_37_02">Might be good to see things from the roofs, huh? For sure. Look for a ladder to get up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_54_02">This is not your quiet neighborhood police kiosk. Be ready for anything.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_intro_01_02">Almost there, gang. Get those clown masks on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_18_01">That must be FEDS - Taxman is being set up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_14">...what&apos;s the worst that could happen, right?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_65_02">Make sure the police don&apos;t interfere.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_cnc_01">Friends, fancy a bit of fun in the desert? There&apos;s a Murky facility that needs looting.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_45_02">There&apos;s space between the trains too. It&apos;s worth a look.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_34_03">This was found by our &quot;tomb raider&quot; division. They&apos;re great guys. Drink like fucking micks though.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_intro_a_03">Trustee bank is up ahead. Go in, find the vault, blaze the money, video the whole thing and get out. FBI is on the highest alert so make it quick and clean. Let&apos;s do it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_62_01">Get to the weapons lab, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_104_01">Guys, they&apos;re throwing everything they have at you. Better make it out, fast!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_37_01">Yoohoooooo! Send the bags up here, my friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_07_02">The evidence that Hoxton spoke of will be in that lock-up. Look for it. It should be marked out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_brief_01b">I&apos;ve set up the meeting location. You meet in an abandoned trainyard. Good luck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_32_03">Right!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_62_any_02">OK, I got to bail!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_69_04">Those bastards put the fire out!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_05b_any_05">... real close now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_90_03">No time friends, you gotta secure the artifact!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_08_09">Can you clowns keep the noise down out there? I&apos;m resting in here.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_09_any_05">Fucking move it, guys!</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_31_02">Awesome! Let&apos;s go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_70_03">There&apos;s a lovely little prototype in one of those crates, dear friends. Open them to find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_c1_02">It&apos;s caustic soda.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_48_02">See if you can cut the lights in his office through a nearby circuit breaker.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_47_01">Remember to check inside the buildings for the remaining keycard.</string>
	 <string id="bru_run_03_01">Fuck! The cops got roadblocks everywhere! It&apos;s like they knew! I&apos;ll pick you guys up a bit further ahead!</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_11_08">They fuckin&apos; shot Brown in the face!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_05b_any_01">... going as fast as I can!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_05_01">I will send in the necessary ingredients for you. Hold tight.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_19_04">Winston won&apos;t be happy!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap06_02a">How long, depends on how many sins you have done. And your sins, they are many, you fucker.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_26_04">That drill isn&apos;t going to move itself, friends.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_25">WPD&apos;s on our tail like a bad date!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_38_02">There&apos;s two cans of thermite there. One of you other guys grab it.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_03_02">One minute.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_95_03">I would be very surprised if they didn&apos;t have a special safe where the keycard might be.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_19_03">Guys! Every time the mercenaries mess with the EMP, the charging process decreases! Don&apos;t let them touch it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_42_03">When you feel ready, go ahead and make your way out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_27_01">There we go. Money in a box!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_109_02">Those shelves look a bit out-of-place. Make sure to search them thoroughly!</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_28_01">Guys, I&apos;m gonna need some help getting out of here with this stuff.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_01_01">First, see if you can get inside. You might want to try a quiet approach.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_30_02">So, here&apos;s the plan. Get a hose down the hole from up top, and blow a pack of C4 inside the water filled safe. After that, grab the loot and get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_59_02">There... that person has the look of someone who spends all day hooking up servers. Get him to open up the lock on the security bars.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_16_02">Once you&apos;re out of there we can talk some more about what&apos;s going on. It&apos;s gonna get rough I suspect.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_11_any_02">Incoming! From the lumber mill! Stay on your toes!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_38_01">Take care of those lasers, yeah? Chop chop!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_43_01">Perfect.  Now blow the wall and let&apos;s get the hell out of here.</string>
	 <string id="crn_man_00_02">I&apos;m doing this. I&apos;m committed. Limo&apos;s going bye bye.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_109_03">Time to move!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_100_03">The Murkys are going to try and stop the drill, so don&apos;t let them!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_47_01">Better stand clear, friends. This could get messy!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_12_02">Hey, that&apos;s a GENSEC armored transport! If you break it open you could steal some cash too!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_21_04">You need to go and activate the crane, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_18_02">Now we need to get through the vault door. Two keycard terminals need to be activated, within a small window. Find two keycards.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap06_03">You will see soon enough, my dear Buluc. You will see.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_57_02">The code has been blocked, so forget about it. Going to need another solution.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_96_03">Aha, the cargo manifest. A little intel on the containers is always useful. It&apos;s still general, but it narrows the field. Nice job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_16_01">What do you think guys? It looks pretty good in there. Grab what you can handle!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_04_02">Could be useful somewhere down the line.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_80_03">Open the garage doors, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_32_02">No need to carry that artifact around, just put it on the conveyor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_33_02">This place has a formidable vault. Thankfully, I found just the tool for it. Get that bag to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_92_04">Hop in the elevator guys, then get your asses to the roof!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_02_any_03">Guys, this is R.G.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_11_03">Now just raise the balloon and let the pilot do the rest.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_21_02">Great. Now start loading that cage with bags.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_41_01">I saw a conveyor chute over there. Throw the loot in. It connects to the kitchen of...hang on.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_01_01">Cars? Uh ok, yeah I can do that. Where is it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_21_02">Thermite&apos;s done its job. Now hook that water pump up to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_07_07">Saw those trucks open and find him!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_41_01">You&apos;ve got all you need. Time to mix that cocktail! Get it all together, and arm the bomb.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_07_any_01">Alright, that&apos;s the door to the server room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_06_01">The bikers are apparently storing stuff in an old bunker. The mechanic said you would find a seat for the bike in there.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_09_01a">What is this, some kind of crime scene tv shit?$NL;$NL;$NL;</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_51_01">Maybe if we send him an &apos;urgent email&apos;? There&apos;s another compromised computer near you we can use. Go find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_118_02">Dunno what that is, but we got it. Now, back to the car!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_intro_a_03">Ah, it&apos;s a FBI operation - no way out! They&apos;re going to take you down unless you shoot your way out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_26_any_01">Great! That&apos;s the server, now set up the connection.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_08_03">Accessing now...</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_01_01">Well look at this! I thought I was never getting out of here. You untie me please?</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_03_07">I can&apos;t get a good angle on those snipers! You need to take them out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_45_03">Yeah! Thats the sweet sound of success. Get yourselves in the basement and check what&apos;s in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_101_02">You can do it faster if you set up a zipline.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_08_01">Blerrie! All the doors are sealed. You&apos;re going to have to find another way into the vault room. Get up to the second floor and look for a weakness in the floor or something, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="plt_run_09_02">Get that guy into the chopper. Come on, go!</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_02_03">Asshole! That&apos;s not snow falling. That&apos;s my fucking product. My fucking product! Thanks to you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_54_02">Find the computer. Send Moretta the GPS data.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_56_02">Ah, they&apos;ve gone and messed up your cocktail. You gotta mix up a new one, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_14_02">Now we wait for the time lock to run down. Did I ever tell you about my grandpa and his heisting days?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_09a_01">There. Now just give me a minute.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_54b_01">Settle down, you chop. They&apos;re not going to be cutting off any legs today, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_cnc_01">Time to have your tuxedos pressed, yeah? Let&apos;s crash an auction.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_42_01">Open up the elevator shaft. The van&apos;s waiting for you in the garage.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_116_02">Don&apos;t let BFD overheat. Refill that tank with water!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_32_02">If you want to dump bodies into the sea, you can use the windows.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_32_01">This is gonna take a while. Make sure to protect the winches while they are working their magic.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_06_01">OK, great! Get that sack of cash to the van.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58d_01">No good staying around there. Get going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_05_any_01">Burn it all. Most of it is marked anyway, the feds would be all over us.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_73_02">There&apos;s no juice in the office, friends. You gotta hook it up again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_82_02">Look for a code that starts with one.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_08_03">The cops will get you before you get me. And I will live!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_14_02">That invoice should point you to the right guard, so you can get the keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_14_any_03">50 grand worth of stuff down the drain!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_28_03">You&apos;ll need the FBI boss to get past the retinal scanner. Find him. Lead him there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_10_any_03">The escape helicopter is here folks. If you&apos;re feeling greedy you can go get the rest of the bags - otherwise, time to run!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_76_01">That rug looks wrong. My guess is it&apos;s covering a hatch. Well, we&apos;ll worry about that later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_19_any_01">You clever bastards, you&apos;ll get around them using those tunnels.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_81_03">Crap, they&apos;re fast. Get the power back on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58h_01">Now light it up and give it a big push, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_20_any_03">Unless you still want the cops to show up you better be careful around those workers</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_37_03">Don&apos;t forget to get the cutter onto the vault, heisters. Slice it open from beneath.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_41_03">That wasn&apos;t it. Got to give it some time to reset, then try again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_20_01">Ok, you know which wine we&apos;re looking for! Find it!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_08b_any_03">Double-time it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_17_02">Get to the escape car!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_27_02">Just pull the switch, guys</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_29_02">A second hatch. What&apos;s the Commissar hiding in there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_requirement_07_bags">Remember guys, we need seven bags to escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_02_03">Keep an eye out for anything you can hustle out of there. The Murkywater containers are your best bet - get them open.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_17_01">Cops are still on the boat!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_05_01">I&apos;m not taking any chances, gang. Search any boxes you see. Worst case scenario is you find other valuables.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_15_03">See if the manager has left a cup or something lying around.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_136_03">What? You don&apos;t want to get away scot-free? Well, I do, so please hurry up and take all of those pardons!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_18_03">Dammit! That&apos;s the FEDS! </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_19_02">See if that print will get the safe open so you can reach the key.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_40_05">Tanks on the door ASAP.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_119_01">Get ready for extraction. Chopper is 4 minutes out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_34_02">You now have all parts of the code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_22_any_07">Try caustic soda... Or hydrogen... No no, wait, soda... Go for that. Yeah.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_05_01">The daily code for the time lock on the vault. Shall I send someone over?</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_14_03">Not to worry friends, I&apos;ve gotten in touch with Twitch. He&apos;s not too far out and will come get you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_05_to_departure">Hurry up, guys! The escape vehicle is leaving in five minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_68_03">Blues are trying to pull the plug on us, make sure they fail!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_11_03">Do my ears deceive me, or was that the sweet sound of another of Vlad&apos;s presents hitting the floor? Look for it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_23_03">...my courier hid it in a dumpster on the parking lot outside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_07_02">Find some way past the gates without raising any suspicions.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_74_02">My, that door is a beast. See if the armory has something that can help you break it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_01_01">Cops on the way! Let&apos;s go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_15_02">Vault is open. Start stacking that cash, gang.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_88_01">The code should have a seven at the beginning.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_76_03">Damn! It&apos;s the alarm. Well, this just got more straightforward. Forget keycards. We&apos;re blowing our way through. Light a flare and drop it. Bile will drop you some C4.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_94_02">OK, now you can take all of Vlad&apos;s special loot and bring it out to the van.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_102_04">You need to prepare the next part of the formula.</string>
	 <string id="pln_art_intro_01_01">Let&apos;s hope we can be as successful as last time. Hit it, gang.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_17_03">Ship is still attacked by cops onboard.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_13_02">You&apos;re doing good, my friends. But that&apos;s just the first. Find the second pallet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_09_02">Gang, you need to get the truck down. Maybe a little firepower.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_24_02">The escape van won&apos;t be able to get through unless you move those police cars!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_03_02">That&apos;s the lasers shut down! Move on, let&apos;s see what&apos;s next.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_22_02">Alarms are off the display cases. You want to snatch some extra goodies, now is the time. Can always shift these artifacts.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_26_any_01">Wow! Guys? Are you OK? I told you to be careful!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_36_04">Time to cut our friend loose!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_20_01">Find the Jaegerheister and spike it. Green bottle.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_75_01">C&apos;mon friends, get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_05_01">You do realize, thermite is more or less standard equipment for us.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_19_01">Ok, you&apos;re at the top now, right? Have him buckle up in the chair, then release the balloon. The plane will be there any minute now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_101_01">The cops opened the entrance gate!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_18_02">OK. Now let&apos;s restart the time lock and see if this worked.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_07_any_01">Looks like some codes, that&apos;ll come in handy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_99_02">Every little bit helps, but the rocks in cases are most important.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_111_01">Get the hell out before they find you!</string>
	 <string id="sys_hb2_04_03">Security door de-activated.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_56_04">There aren&apos;t any monsters behind those doors. I promise, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_101_01">All right, we got what we came for. You can bail or go back, clean The Grin.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_04c">Maybe they&apos;ll have aliens.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_41_04">You have to open up that ark-dinges.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_31_02">We&apos;re in. Alright, keep the cops off it. Might take some time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_69_01">Keep those routers safe.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_08a_any_03">Alright, I&apos;m at the spot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_69_02">Don&apos;t let the cops near the routers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_04_02">The ship by the docks belongs to the Butcher! Locke sold her out too. Give them a hand and maybe they&apos;ll give you a ride.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_32_01">Deploy C4 inside the vault! Then get ready.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_10_any_02">Time to deliver the bags!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_92_02">Your ride is ready friends, get onboard!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_71_02">You should see Bile at any time now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_07_any_02">Seems like the deal was a gold arms transaction. Made here in DC.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_19_04">Look at that. The kerels must think we&apos;re idiots, making an offer so low. Let&apos;s see how far they will go, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_05a_any_01">I&apos;m there in two...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_60_02">The artifact, friends. Get it and go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_66_05">That evidence won&apos;t burn without some lighting fluid!</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_34_01">Hahaa, cavalry&apos;s here!</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_05_08">Hope the radiation isn&apos;t getting to you. But, on bright side, maybe you develop super-powers, yes?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_47_any_02">Hmm we got a slight problem. Chopper is running out of fuel after all these back and forths. He will be back after refueling. Hold you ground!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_11_03">Alright! The van should be coming in soon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_73_03">Splendid, absolutely splendid! I confirmed the transaction of 25 million.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_87_01">The code should have a six at the beginning.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_44_05">Hurry friends, pick up the box.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_69_02">You got that USB yet? Surely IT will have one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_30_01">What are you waiting for, you mendicants?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_50_05">Hurry now, go find the artifact in the bio-lab.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_46_03">Great! Now get to the counting room, right above the vault, and get that thermite to work!</string>
	 <string id="plt_run_05_03">Clear skies. I&apos;m coming in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_39_03">He should still be alive, right? </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_39_03">Maybe it&apos;s right there in plain sight.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_07d_01">It&apos;s way out there, behind the parking lot. The door to the unit is pretty thick and I don&apos;t have the key. We&apos;ll need to cut it open. Should be a saw around here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_15_03">Use the zipline to secure the bags.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_49_01">Excellent. They are blind! Blind as a bat. Though bats are supposed to be blind, and locate prey by echolocation, so that is...</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_20_04">I can see one of the civilians making a run for it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_151_03">Gang. You gotta scan and fax over the blueprints. Sure that can be done in IT.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap03_01">Hello my friend.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_10_01">Ok get the shoes!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_16">The cops are on our tail!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_17">...and cross your fingers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_65_06">No need to stay there longer. Take the box and make for extraction.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_36_01">Off we go! Get in the car everyone!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_05_02">Diamonds are forever, but good coke disappears fast. Go get it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_18_02">Guys the timer stopped!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_41_02">Get the loot to the roof, gang. I got a chopper en-route.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_01_any_01">OK, this is it. Quick in, get Vlad&apos;s tiara. You want more, it&apos;s your call.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_15_02">Reinforcements are incoming.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_106_01">The cage is ready. When you&apos;re ready for the plane, send up that balloon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_01_02">Ah hell. Heat is on the way. Guess the cops were watching the place.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_brief_01">The senator loves to collect art - outsider art in particular. Lucky for us, the Capitol Art Gallery is hosting an exhibition this week.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_13_01">The case files here say that there&apos;s some forensic evidence linked to the traitor. Head to the labs and get a closer look.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_30_01">Come on, we&apos;re nearly done!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_56_01">Look everywhere you need to.. the lounge... library. You get the idea.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_11_02">That&apos;s the door. Now grab the stuff.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_23_any_02">Damn it! Someone just tripped the alarm!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_82_03">An access ladder, with the hatch unlocked. These sloppy assholes deserve to be robbed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_32_03">Into the hole, petrolhead!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_34_03">Are you looking for the second box?</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_04_05">Hold the door!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_03_02">Perhaps... muriatic acid?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_02_01">You&apos;ll have about seven seconds to take out the cameras before the alarm goes off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_120_02">Get to the roof and signal the chopper if you&apos;re ready to leave!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_08_01">You&apos;ll never get me! You fucking clowns are DONE!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_12_01">Hurry up guys, you need to move to the other building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_35_02">There&apos;s no turning back - get out of this goddamn place!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_72_01">Did you just break a vial? Don&apos;t get that stuff on you!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_25_01">Come on, you kaks! Strap the money to the chopper so I can take it away!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_47_02">Apres vous!</string>
	 <string id="plt_mad_06_01">Huh, well it&apos;s on the outside. Should work anyway right?</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_02_01">Guys, it feels like something&apos;s in the air... Money!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_06_01">Blerrie! First floor is blocked off. Get up to the 2nd by the scaffolding outside. Should be a door you can hack through with a saw.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_23_02">It will open in a second or two. And then... </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_51_03">Can&apos;t see it anywhere, so the box is probably behind that door and you got to get through it. Maybe you can cook up something useful and nasty to eat through it, yeah? Looks like there are some good chems lying around.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_02_02">See if you can find a way up to the next level. There should be a hatch or something nearby. Murky chops may not be expecting us, but be ready for anything.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_13_06">Hurry back to the warehouse with those diamonds, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_09_01">Second transport is open - check inside!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_38_03">One last thing. You got to open the gates so you can take off. Move fast, cause the Murkys will jump on us if they realize what&apos;s going on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_90_03">Enter the correct symbols in correct order with the help of the codex and clues you have.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_56_01">Get ready, guys. Moretta&apos;s almost at her berth.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_67_04">Drill the door, you chops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_19_02">Gang, you need to locate that turret.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_77_03">Go ahead and light it up, Twitch. Hold your ears, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_12_02">Watch out! It stopped on drills again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_10_01">The Commissars&apos; guys&apos;ve got some hot wheels. How about we make them a little hotter? Look around the gas station, there&apos;s gotta be something to burn.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_72_04">No good dropping vials, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_08_any_01">Alright, the process is on, It&apos;s cooking. I have a contact with a specialist through Hector. I will guide you guys through it.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_02_01">Oh, right. Yeah, sure. OK, have him check in when he can.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_20_any_08">Hm, yeah it is not caustic soda... Yeah. It should be acid. Yep, sure that is it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_86_01">Restart the shutdown, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_12_02">You gotta use the cameras to find Bain!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_32_03">Looks like it&apos;s working. Will take some time before it&apos;s full.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_10_02">Nicely done. Next, we need a detonator on those charges. Rig it up, won&apos;t you?</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_13_01">That boat is your only way out of there, so do whatever the Captain needs.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_11_03">Get to searching for the code, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_18_02">You found a blowtorch, and now you need to actually use it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_46_01">Moxie&apos;s Milkshakes!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_96_02">Inspect  the walls, too!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_49_03">The cops pulled the hack. Get there and reboot it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_09_any_01">Make shure no SWATs get in to the lab. Keep them away at all costs!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_51_01">They must be around here somewhere. One minute...</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_07_03">Get that gate open and search the boxes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_24_any_01">Add hydrogen chloride, to continue the process!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_h_05">Yeah it&apos;s soda, caustic soda.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_01_01">OK, guys. Remember:  computer, blood sample, validation and then get the hell out by the elevator. Oh, and I hope you brought something to take out the security cameras with.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_45_02">Take the winch chain and hook it to the teller window!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_14_01">And now we wait. Anyone have any good stories?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_113_02">That place is gonna collapse. Climb outta there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_02_01">Search the arena for the supply closets marked with a red X. That&apos;s where the C4 is.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_36_02">Time to go guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_09_02">Ach, it&apos;s rigged with C4! Look out, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_19_01">OK, OK. The code is likely in some email. Find an FBI computer and gain access to it.</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_04_02">Someone always wants to fuck my Christmas! Here come the cops. Don&apos;t let them screw the elves, yes?</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_01_any_01">OK, find a way inside, stay low, and keep an eye out for guards and cameras.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_14_03">You need to open that gate to get the briefcase. See if you can find some thermite.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_07_08">Great work! Man, these kids are gonna remember this as the greatest night of their lives.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_74_04">You gotta restart the electricity!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_06_any_02">Bingo. Pick it up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_09_01">You&apos;ve been made! Damn, this is gonna get messy. Just keep hacking, I&apos;ll think of something.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_99_03">The cannon is ready to fire, hit the button.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_50_any_02">There it is! Finally!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_14_02">Question marks again. Be ready for anything.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_68_04">The door&apos;s not going to open until you get that drill going!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_02">...I... think.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_16_01">Put some gas on those tires. We need to block that eye in the sky.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_10_02">It should be hydrogen chloride!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_22_02">OK, hose looks good. Now get the pump started.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_60_02">To disable this we need to hack the laptop that is hooked up to it. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_23_03">Watch the heat rise. You&apos;ll get that reboot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_30_02">Those wagons are bound for military decommissioning. One of &apos;em&apos;s gotta have C4.</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_05_07">Those nicely wrapped packages of coke are still coming down! Bring as many as you can!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_80_03">Not perfect, but seven points for effort!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_25_06">You&apos;re doing this for Hox, so let&apos;s get a move on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_26_03">Just one more override.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_36_01">How is it going?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_06b_any_02">... got the pedal to the metal!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_42_03">That&apos;s the head of security. Hmm... looks like he&apos;s at the back of the house.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_h_07">I messed up. It should&apos;a been soda.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_96_02">Alright you chops, that&apos;s enough for Vlad. Get out of there as soon as you&apos;re ready!</string>
	 <string id="btm_cs1_01_05">I can do that for you, ma&apos;am. </string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_04_01">Yeah get me out of these chains man.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_25_01">Halfway now, just two more overrides to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_20_06">One of the civilians is trying to escape!</string>
	 <string id="bkm_cs1_01_03">A new account. We can get that sorted right away.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_32_03">Keep it quiet, gang, but keep it moving. Get down to the garage.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_14_01">Four.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_25_02">Great! Now we can get out of here. Get to the escape. Follow the blue containers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_18_any_01">Folks, the escape driver&apos;s coming in hot - he&apos;s gonna need some protection.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_38_01">...Now, you gotta connect the hook to the vault door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_81_03">Maybe you can find something to get in there. Have a look in the utility closet if you can find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_58_02">Drop the C4 into to the safe and blow it open. The water will do the trick.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_96_01">Maybe check behind one of the paintings?</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_29_01">Thanks a bunch fellas! See you at the warehouse!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_12_06">Portable computers. Times three.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_15_02">This is good security. A code and a retinal scanner.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_15_01">OK, we&apos;re in. Get in that vault, start moving the loot out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_43_02">OK guys - while the drill does the lock, we&apos;re going to deal with the gates&apos; magnetic seal. Let me find a good terminal.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_05_01">Hydrogen... chloride. Ach, nasty!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_83_01">Start cracking those boxes. We need one bag, but let&apos;s try and take them for everything!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_24_03">Sweet! The bridge is fixed! Now into the car, people! Time to leave this behind!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_c2_01">...caustic soda?</string>
	 <string id="plt_chw_01_01">Gentlemen, I see an opening for me to come in a short period of time. If you have any loot to secure, now is the time. I&apos;ll be at the back of the train.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_01_02">Took you long enough!</string>
	 <string id="pln_misc_sj_dgh_01_01">There they are, just like Wick said they would be. Get them to the van and tie them up for now. We&apos;ll bring them back with us when we leave. Wick wants to have a &quot;chat&quot;, you see. </string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_66_any_02">That&apos;s fine, I&apos;ll pick that one up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_105_02">According to what I&apos;ve learned, the PEOC entrance is by the library. Make your way there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_126_01">Ah, there we go, friends!</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_09_03">The boss just called and he&apos;s pissed. Got a guy comin&apos; to get us but you should probably bail. I&apos;ll make sure you get your cut.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_55_01">That codex! Those symbols... that&apos;s the key to the Mayan door, yeah? Look around for more clues!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_33_03">You have to search the mainframe again to locate the second box. Quickly, now</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_04_02">I&apos;ve left you a keycard, an arc cutter and some breaching charges, my friends. I could press a button and open a door, but we must hide my involvement, yes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_19_01">Get the car keys in the storage room!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_05_any_02">Five thousand dollars, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_12_01">Six.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_18_02">Chop kerels have shut down power to the lab. Find the wall box and get it up again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_78_01">Keep going damnit! </string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_75_05">Keep looking for the armory!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_24_02">The symbols in that codex. That&apos;s how we get the Mayan dinges to open. There must be more clues around there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_54_04">You still gotta hack into those access points.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_43_01">That&apos;s the vault, fo&apos; sho&apos;.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_10secs_to_arrival">Ten seconds.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_87_03">Just a few... More... Seconds.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_51a_01">Oh, my god!</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt2_02_01">My brother-in-law - you remember that old soak - will be coming in with a skyhook cage.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_55_02">Come on, we watched the show and you know how to do it. Set the C4!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_37_02">Three minutes, tops!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_20">God damn!</string>
	 <string id="bkl_brn_01_02">Retribution time!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_59_01">He passed out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_09_any_02">I&apos;m in... Good work. Gimme a sec here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_19_02">The terminals, guys. Get the power back up and restart the override.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_06_03">Another security buffer kicked in.Need to be disconnected manually.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_04_01">Now get inside that building!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_24_any_02">Nice work! I gave the pilot the word to get you to the docks because you aren&apos;t done yet.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_24_02">The code will be stored on the auctioneer&apos;s PC, so get hacking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_06_03">You&apos;re looking for two points of access.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_112_03">Remember to sort the fireworks. Light up the night sky.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_07_01">So, now start pump to transfer fuel.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_07_03">That&apos;s the second lock. Get the codebreaker on it too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_112_02">Hmm, that computer had a partial code to the vault. There must be more parts of it around there.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_02_any_01">Alright, I&apos;m here. Get the bags over here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_22_03">Damn. Those patrol men? Looks like they&apos;re buddies are coming to find them. Coming in force!</string>
	 <string id="csm_cs1_01_01">I wanted to ask if you guys offer financing for auto-mobiles?</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_06_03">Tiaras, nuclear warheads, and safes. Just another job for Vlad.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_30_02">You still got a lotta Murkys walking about, so hurry and get that code entered!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_20_02">That goat&apos;s a trouble maker. He somehow turned on the power. Disable it at the power box.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_06_02">Stow the loot in the ceiling vent marked by the Inside Man.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_19_07">It was a bad move to ambush me!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_i_05">Yeah it&apos;s chloride, hydrogen chloride.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_intro_01_02">Maybe I&apos;m just used to it, but I suppose this equipment is due for an upgrade. I&apos;ll look into it.$NL;</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_46_02">Those suits will come in handy, later. </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_71_03">Good thing you found that blueprint. </string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_38_03">I love shopping. I just don&apos;t like to pay. Vlad doesn&apos;t pay, he takes what he wants.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_134_03">Gambling is a disease. Stop while you can, sucker!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_02_any_01">This is R.G.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_05_any_02">OK crew, you have enough to get the hell out now. If you want more then I need access to the surveillance room. I&apos;ll do the rest once you get in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_76_02">Bunch of kakspul! See if you can find the code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_25_02">OK, get to the controls. I&apos;ve got something planned.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_50_any_03">OK, that&apos;s the tiara!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_27_03">Boom! That&apos;s how it&apos;s done. I hope the CIA were taking notes. Now book it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_27_03">Go get the teddy bear from the reception, then take out the saw and set it up on the doors.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_02_03">It&apos;d be very helpful if you could deal with those snipers. Yes?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_94_01">The thermite has burned through, so get inside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_18_01">Damn kerels have cut the power to the terminals. Find the power box and get it back up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_01_02">Ok, friends. Let&apos;s get this over with, nice and easy. First thing to do is get past the security entrance. Shouldn&apos;t be too hard, but go have a look at the gates.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_08_01">Well, the front door&apos;s closed.  No surprise. Look for another way in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_17_01">Good. There&apos;s the circuit box. Rewiring it should do a hard reset on the time lock.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_71_01">Another vault opens. Bravo!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_05_02">Remember, you&apos;re looking for the chief kerel&apos;s computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_42_03">The rat was Hector!? He used to say that there were a lot of stupid criminals in the world. Apparently he was one of them for thinking he could screw us over.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_33_02">That boat needs people inside it. You people. Do what the boat needs, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_35_03">Time for plan B. Start the countdown.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_33_02">Explosive&apos;s in. And...</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_09_02">Okay, I&apos;ll have the guys put the cage together on the road.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_01_any_02">To show just how serious Vlad is, we are going to destroy 50 grand worth of pretty things.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_28_01">Holy crap, the plane&apos;s going down! Hope the pilot bailed. We need another plan. </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_43_03">I do believe we can put that ladder to good use. Yeah, for sure!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_16_02">Look around for a ladder. You need it to search the wagons. Maybe it&apos;s still attached to one of them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_15_03">There you go, now just wait for it to open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_21_01">That truck looks perfect. Now get the safes loaded on board - all of them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_71_01">That&apos;s it, I&apos;m done!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_01_02">Now remember - we&apos;re here to rob a bank. But if, by some accident, you shoot up a ballot machine or three, well... That&apos;s just tough titty. Understand?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_44_06">You need to look faster gang. Time is running out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_13_06">This might be the one.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_18">I thought we lost that damn helicopter in the tunnel!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_43_01">Get the saw going. Cut through the roof and drag him out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_27_02">Dead on target! Our flyboy earned his cut today.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_39_01">That hole is HUGE! Perfect!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_11_02">You need to hack more machines. Every hack piles more scandal on Schwartz.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_01_01">This is it guys, this is it. Hey Locke, you didn&apos;t forget the gold, did you?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_21_02">Grab the encrypted flash drive. It should be in a laptop somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_04_03">Toss those tablets into the mixer, crew.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_02_01">Get your mask on, and out of the damn crate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_53_02">Get those bags out, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_91_02">Nine</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_10_01">Catch!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_33_01">There&apos;s a lot of pricey stuff around here. But check the cases for alarms - they&apos;ll be the ones with the genuine stuff. </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_10_01">Kiff thinking, friends. Now you gotta get past the security gate.</string>

	 <string id="pln_bo2_50_any_01">Blackhawk on the roof! This looks bad guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_16_01">Friends, I know you still don&apos;t trust me, but we&apos;ll talk more once you&apos;re away from the cops, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_39_02">See if you can find any explosive fuel around there to make cocktail with. Coyopas are known to use C4, and maybe some diesel and fertilizer for good measure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_65_03">Hurry up now. Take it and get out.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_cnc_01">I&apos;ve had some problems with pirates in the Caribbean. I need you to go to Miami and solve these problems for me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_20_01">Well, what do have we here? Military blueprints! Let me investigate this. </string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_04_02">Each vault door has a security system, and that drive will hack it open. Should be useful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_14_01">Woah! Be careful with that stuff. That&apos;s military grade explosives you&apos;re throwing around.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_96_02">Watch out for spiders, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap02_02">Better than your fucking brother-in-law, right? What&apos;s his name... Hoojin or some shit? What the fuck do you want?</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_46_02">Get down to the basement guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_33_02">You could hide the bodies by throwing them into the sea at the back of the boat.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_89_02">Ok, friends. Get the loot onto the helicopter.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_167_04">And the price? 18 bucks. How you like that, huh?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_04_04">Keep things cool. Don&apos;t give the nosey neighbours something to talk about.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_108_03">Dwankie politicians... hiding the doors to important places. Tear the place apart if you need to.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_26_any_02">What!? Run that server out of there guys - you might make it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_11_01">What the - they lowered the Diamond into the floor. OK, well, we need to break through! Get a drill on there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_70_01">Good, that did it! Now get to the vault!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_09_any_02">Coming in now - just can&apos;t tell you what dock yet!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_49_04">The power is down. You need to restore it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_19_02">Can&apos;t go down that way, they&apos;ll hear you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_14_02">The hole in that floor isn&apos;t going to get bigger, by itself friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_19_02">Okay. Now help your friend Locke. Light a flare. Show me where the money is.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_77_01">Get after him, and wait for your chance.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_01_01">Remember, we can&apos;t sell damaged cars so no cops. Keep it quiet. I&apos;ll let you know when you can plant the C4 on the road.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_12_01">Are you done with that gate yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_77_01">Have you found the code yet? Look around real good.</string>
	 <string id="crn_man_01_05">Like... a glooove!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_07_03">We need a blank key tag so we can code it to open the doors. See if you can find one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_04_02">The bike isn&apos;t going to function without an engine. The mechanic said he saw some inside the clubhouse.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_05_03">That silo looks like a good drop zone. Putting it there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_95_01">They&apos;ll keep the keycard in a safe, no doubt. </string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_58_03">Get outside, friends! Twitch is incoming with the van!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_06_03">Just hold off the armies of darkness. Ingredients are almost with you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_106_02">You gotta go to the library!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_22_any_02">Check for Alex ammo drop... Panic room all over again...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_19_01">Don&apos;t forget the terminals, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_74_03">Kick the shit out of the exacutive ladder. Find the CFO and get his master code!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_72_07">The charge process needs to be started again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_60_01">You need to leave, friends!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_22">We got a tail - and they&apos;re getting closer!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_17_any_02">OK, they locked the server. Get that barrier open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_41_01">Just keep it cool and follow our friend.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_19_01b">I don&apos;t know about you guys, but I&apos;m dying of thirst. Would any of you be a sweetheart and grab me a coke from the vending machine?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_71_03">Crap, not good enough. Get another one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_18_01">That noise... Ahh some suspicious neighbours called the cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_92_03">Haul ass back to the chopper, clowns.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_100_01">See guys, it&apos;s a bad idea to cook meth in a small, closed space like a container.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_gwd_04">Great! You defeated that wave of cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_66_03">The gear could be at the smoking area. Perhaps Micho left your gear there. Look for a guitar case.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_37_01">I&apos;m going to have the ground team assemble the cage on the bank roof. Over.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_11_01">Drills? Not sure what that is...</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_depositbox_stage1_brief_01">Now we&apos;re getting into the bank vault. This job is about deposit boxes. You need to get in there and drill that vault. Case the bank first. They&apos;re wired out the ass with security cameras and trigger-happy guards.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_37_02">The plane is full, you can take off the hose.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_27_01">These are the shells for the turret. Valuable, but not the main prize. Get the turret, and then come back for this ordnance.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_43_01">Good! Now steal one of the police cars and get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_01_04">Remember, we need to keep these cars in pristine condition. No scratches, and definitely no bullet holes. Which means no cops. So keep it quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_68_01">Still no alarm. Outstanding. Now open the gate.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_intro_03b">I don&apos;t envy you friends. Gotta be a lot of spiders in that house. Awful things, crawly beasties.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_05_03">...hydrogen chloride?</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_19_10">You don&apos;t know who you&apos;re dealing with!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_11_01">Great. Now get it to the vault. We&apos;re doing this the old fashioned way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_34_01">Ok, that&apos;s the code. Remember it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_36_any_01">What are you doing!? You didnt even make it inside, Let&apos;s go to plan B, and next time, stay low.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_random_stage1_brief_02">The Harvest &amp; Trustee is a vulnerable bank so I see an opportunity for us. Case it so you can find out where. You&apos;re going to need to get into the vault using a thermal drill, get whatever&apos;s in there bagged up and moved back to the escape car. Use your judgment and don&apos;t be greedy... Good luck, folks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_07_any_03">One more minute! Pick-up&apos;s almost here!</string>

	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_11_any_03">Tiara is in that building, I&apos;m sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_brief_01">OK, we&apos;re going to pay a visit to the Tasteful club and uh, liberate their cash reserve. Nothing special. Find the manager&apos;s office, contain the crowd, make sure we leave in one piece. </string>

	 <string id="loc_jr2_26_02">I&apos;m hearing that the kerel are sending more SWAT turrets to take out my helicopter. I can&apos;t pick you up in town. But I prepared for this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_56_04">There goes all the good prints... That&apos;s a shame.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_34_03">Careful! The roof is about to collapse!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_25_01">You gotta get down to the garage and plant that C4.</string>

	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_14">The police is on our back like a fucking pony tail!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_09_01">No reason to stay quiet now. Chopper&apos;s on it&apos;s way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_36_03">I was afraid of this. The containers are shut and locked. Gonna have to drill them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_90_02">Van&apos;s ready and waiting, gang. Move it!</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_07_02">Ok... attach the magnet please.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_173_02">Armory needs a three digit code. You can find the digits throughout the Grin. Get to it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_115_02">This is the same type of vault as the one you did in that LA job last year. But we&apos;ll have to hack our way into this one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_56_01">Now if you&apos;re a good liar... That&apos;s a whole other ballgame.</string>

	 <string id="pln_spa_11_03">It&apos;s the roof, guys. Get moving!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_66_01">Empty? Blerrie, Garrett must not have gotten it from Evidence yet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_50_02">Good job, gang. The server has been secured and Jimmy will be happy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_84_03">C&apos;mon, you gotta get in there. Use that torch.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_122_03">You already found the bomb. You can leave the containers alone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_34_02">Drill the van open! Get it out of the way! </string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_79_02">You need to check the rooms, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_20_03">Old Locke has arranged a stash of gear for you,friends.</string>

	 <string id="vld_ko1b_04_02">Now bring them to the train yard. You&apos;ll be far away before they know it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_70_03">Get to a centrifuge and test that sample.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_44_any_01">Aw, so it&apos;s empty!? Keep looking!</string>

	 <string id="loc_des_intro_04b">If they have ray guns here, I&apos;m taking some with me.</string>
	 <string id="sys_hb2_03_01">Lowering security door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_51_03">Well, you partially opened the panic room anyway. That means the thermal lance will be quicker!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_04">I&apos;ve seen him take a bullet before. Thought he&apos;d last longer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_01_01">Ok, get in there and get our man out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_10_02">Good! Now grab the goats and throw them in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_53_any_01">Whenever you&apos;re ready, I want you on the roof, then we&apos;ll get you outta there with the zipline.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_01_05">Gotcha, moving!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_37_03">I guess that&apos;s the server room. Make note of it - you should find the cash first.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_61_01">You gotta turn the power back on to get the code!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_03_any_01">That should do it, you can place the drill now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_end_win">Good job friends, that was some quick and easy money for us. Going to buy a lot of nice things we can use to pull off more jobs in the future, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_06_02">I&apos;m in. Hold on, guys - I need a little time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_74_02">I&apos;m sending Bile in to boost that cash out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_08_07">Get it right, or I&apos;ll see you fucked from Austin to Amarillo.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_04_01">Light that flare for Locke, crew.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_77_02">Now! After him. Wait til he&apos;s alone.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_56a_any_03">I got to rush out of here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_06_01">They&apos;ve blocked me. I need you to disconnect their security buffer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_36_01">We&apos;re taking the train - grab the zipline up to the bridge!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_66_01">Crap. That&apos;s Gensec. Get ready to deal with them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_02_02">You need to disable or destroy the anti-air defenses. Find a way, otherwise we&apos;re screwed.</string>

	 <string id="pln_cr2_90_03">Fight your way back to the van, clowns.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_01_02">Now, time for the real dirty work. I used to work as a customs officer in Mariupol. Snap the gloves on. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_31_01">Yes, it worked. It doesn&apos;t seem to matter that the scientist was dead. Technology is cruel. Well, get started with the scanner.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_20b_01">Gonna speed things up. Get that plating off the truck!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_49_06">Kill Garrett&apos;s lights, quickly now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_cnc_01_03">Time to bake some Halloween treats, crew. Get to the forest meth lab.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_02_02">We gotta find the bank manager.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_64_02">Make your way to the boat.        </string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_10_02">Good work. Now, C4 the doors!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_55_01">Great job gang, but now --- get out of there. My systems --- lighting --- a Christmas tree here .--- Something is up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_96_01">Guys, they&apos;re trying to jam the comms. Bile is on the way but he&apos;s gotta be careful. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_69_02">Still no sign of an alarm. Great. Find the comm frequency.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_01_any_04">Boat here, I got the signal - coming in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_17_03">Get me hooked up and I&apos;ll get that door unlocked in just a few moments.</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_03_01">Forget Locke for now, we&apos;ll take care of that scumbag later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_111_01">Keep low until they&apos;ve cleared out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_12_01">Is that one of GENSEC&apos;s armored cash transports? If you open it we could get some additional cash from this job.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_04_03">Metal detectors are now disabled.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_09_any_02">The escape chopper&apos;s in location. Now would be a good time to vacate the premises.</string>
	 <string id="plc_cs1_03_01">Son, you have until I count to sixty to get them over here to this phone, or I&apos;ll send every officer I have to drag your ass to the CTF.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_28_03">Make sure to check the top floor if you wanna leave this place. But there are so many bags...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_45_02">Hey, there he is. Looks like he&apos;s by the driveway.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_04_any_01">It&apos;s a straight cash hit. You know how this goes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_61_02">Right friends, you should get over to the weapons lab. I think they&apos;re keeping one of the boxes in the adjacent room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_73_03">Ach! They&apos;ve cut the power at the emergency shutdown point. Find the lever and pull it back to continue charging</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_109_02">Set up a drill so that you can escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_19_02">Yeah, that&apos;s what I figured. You can&apos;t simply blast through that, but I&apos;ve got an idea.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_20_any_10">I&apos;m coming in at dock eight!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_03_02">There&apos;s going to be a server nearby. The votes are on there. Find it, and wipe it out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_03_01">The alarm systems are disabled. Get inside!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_21_03">And..open the sesame! Bravo, my friends! Now, please, get in the fucking airlock. </string>

	 <string id="pln_nmh_95_01">What the hell... you&apos;re not gonna ... other air units in the area.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap03_02">Is no worse than what you have done, my little Russian friend.</string>

	 <string id="loc_bph_end_fail_01">Friends, this was one job we couldn&apos;t afford to fail. Not good. Not good.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_33_01">Get that bag to the vault. Get the drill assembled.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_06_03">Ah, over there! A Longfellow! 1965, 4.7 litre V8. You guys like to ride in style, right?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_41_01">I got a chopper on the way. Start getting the loot to the roof.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_25_01">Place a call to the FBI HQ. I&apos;ll do the talking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_20b_02">Time to move fast, guys. Yank that armor off the truck.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_14_03">Blueprints... to a vault?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_25_01">Come on, you need to recode that tag.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_68_07">Activate the charge cycle, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_60_02">Blerrie, this guy is persistent. Alright, time to bring in the big guns. Kerels can&apos;t say no to food. If you can find some around there, stick it in front of his office, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_26_04">There has to be something in the area you can use to open that crate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_03_any_01">Alright, we&apos;re in for deposit boxes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_06_03">A white MESA box, just as planned. Get the code breakers going on the locks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_33_02">The garbage truck is waiting for the money bags, come on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_02_06">I think you&apos;ll have to hit him to wake him up.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_60_any_02">30 more seconds, then I&apos;m out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_06_03">Open sesame, yeah? Now get going further in. It&apos;s only going to get worse from here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_56_01">Uh, yeah. Everything is fine and dandy here. Just... routine checkups.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_68_01">They put the fire out with sprinklers!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_21a_03">Solid work, you chops. Go ahead and enter Buluc&apos;s blerrie &quot;sanctum&quot;.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_60_01">Damn, cops got to her! Clear the zone and reactivate BFD!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_40_01">Don&apos;t forget the winch, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_03_01">What are you waiting for? Get inside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_07_03">OK, friends. Hurry out and rescue Mr Pink, right?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_intro_01_02">See that the ship gets out of the dock and berth. Then you can board it and get the explosives. Keep it quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_01_04">This is the last show of the greatest tour on Earth. Don&apos;t screw the pooch now.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_09_02">So, I just heard from the boss. He&apos;s on his way here to get us but he&apos;s pretty pissed, so you guys might wanna bail before he gets here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_50_01">No standing around, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_30_02">Wow, you really did it... You guys are cold. Bring it to the scanner and let&apos;s forget this ever happened.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_13_03">First serving is ready!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_33_03">Garrett likes history, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_09_13">Fire in the hole buddy!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_27_any_02">Am I glad to see this stuff again. Good recovery boys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_24_any_01">Plan B guys! Just get that server.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_33_03">Guys, guys! The garage doors. Murkys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_04_03">...caustic soda, friends?</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_08_any_01">Have a look around - there has to be a way in, we&apos;re losing precious time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_16_02">We&apos;re done. You can leave that crazy Ivan with his nukes, or head back and grab more loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_38_01">Got a plane en route to pick you up, but it can&apos;t land with trees blocking it&apos;s path. Find a saw, clear the trees and mark the landing with flares. Don&apos;t worry, CIA been doing this for years.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_48_04">Let&apos;s go! Bring the key!</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_21_01">It&apos;s on the ground now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_39_01">That&apos;s it! Scan has been completed.Good job, guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_107_01">The Federales are pumping gas through the ventilation system! Stay away from it until it dissipates!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_58_01">Find Chloe&apos;s desk and computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_28_03">You should be able to track the wires and find a way to open this door.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_26b_01">Oh, this is going to be good. Hey guys, tell Buluc goodbye for me, yes?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_53_01">Put the moneybag on the floor and grab some cash!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_34_02">The helicopter will see where we load our containers. Gotta deal with that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_93_02">Well, we didn&apos;t make him any promises about letting him live after seeing me.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_25_03">Disabling one more box should be enough.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_28_03">Cops are rescuing the goats! Is this what tax money pays for!?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_17_02">These cars are tough stuff, but the thermite will melt through easy.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_16_01b">OK, guys, Vlad has arranged a way into the bank for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_57_03">Moretta is berthed and ready for you, clowns.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_fixed_van">Alright, guys! A van is coming in to get you out!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_08_02b">Jesus Christ, what the fuck is going on here? All this shit just because Rust wants his bike back? Well, fuck it. You go and get the parts and bring them here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_68_02">It&apos;s a trap! They were just waiting for us.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_60_04">Put the C4 on the wall and stay back!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_58_02">Now, let&apos;s see what kind of damage we can do.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_31_01">Woah, look at this stuff. It can&apos;t be real... Can it?</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_12_02">The message has been delivered. The job is done, I thank you.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_12">Motherfuckers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_47_03">Find the mic recorder. It&apos;s gotta be there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_79_04">What about that globe?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_114_02">Damn, the system is locked. You have to wait 30 seconds until you can try again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_14_03">Hey man, the kerel poes are fucking you in the ass. Fuck &apos;em back, harder. And fix the fucking detonator!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_12_03">With Buluc&apos;s paranoia, he probably makes his four personal guards share only one keycard to open this door. Maybe they keep a note of it somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_15_03">That&apos;s the last one. Tip toe back to the van, and we can consider this a job well done.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_32_02">They&apos;ve almost on us, friends!</string>
	 <string id="vld_nightclub_brf_outro_02">Go, men - and get me what I want. The night out has just begun!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_tap01_02b">Seems like a solid, straight fellow...</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_42_02">Ach! Did you make it, friends?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_37_02">The bags will be perfectly safe with me. Send them up, please.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_131_03">I need you to help me get past the blocker in the mainframe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_17_02">Ok, it&apos;s the tower on your right! Get him up there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_24_01">I know you want to get out there and start working, but I have to make sure you know the drill. Times change, new equipment, new toys. I just want to make sure you got it all in check.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_17_02">Get that back office door open!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_34_03">See to the pump again, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_45_01">Now, everyone to the chopper! Come on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_12_03">The panic room will be visible as a reinforced door. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_40_01">Blerrie, how long is this thing? Let&apos;s hope it doesn&apos;t interfere with our connection.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_89_02">First briefcase is held by the casino manager. Second by the Pit Boss. Lastly, look for the head of security.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_06_01">Alright, we don&apos;t know which prison transport our man is in, so you&apos;d better place a saw on each one of the four trucks!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_intro_a_01b">Anyway get close, hit &apos;em hard, find the safe, and get whatever intel you can find there. Take all of it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_05_01">Look out! Secondary explosion!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_58_any_03">Two more minutes and I need to go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_86_02">Four</string>
	 <string id="plt_mad_06_02">Oh damn I missed the spot by 20 meters, sorry comrads.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_45_03">Okay, the seal is down. Protect the drill!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_40_any_01">They cut the power! Get it back up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_15_any_01">SWAT responders, coming in hard. Dig in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_95_04">Keep going, get as much as you can!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_18_02">50 percent full.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_01_01">OK, friends. Find Buluc&apos;s wine cellar. That&apos;s a nice, quiet way into the mansion.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_23_02">Hustle it, gang - our pilot can&apos;t stick around forever. Get the bags to the cage.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_92_03">Bile is ready for you friends, get on the helicopter, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_66_03">Ah, the donnerse isn&apos;t here, whatever it is. Garrett probably hasn&apos;t picked it up from the evidence room yet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_26_02">Shoot the gas can!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_requirement_09_bags">Remember guys, we need nine bags to escape.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_57_01">Find Valentine&apos;s desk and computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_19_03">How... eh... gotta think of something... how to get inside...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_14_any_01">Look at the that view...</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_06_03">What the hell is going on up there, shitwipe?!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_22_03">Get to the overpass and then keep going up the hill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_07_01">Your getaway is ready Get as much ammo as you can, and then get yourselves out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_09_any_01">Alright, I&apos;m in, hold on...</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_04_02">And... off we go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_35_02">Almost done. All you gotta do now is get hold of the keycard from Ralph Garnet. Find him and get it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_ctb_01">The cops took one of the bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_04_any_01">Alright, locate the server room and get inside. There&apos;s no point in disabling the alarms now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_07_01">In the meantime, see about finding those three laptops with the code snippets. </string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_49_any_02">Chopper is heading back- sorry it took so long.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_11_02">I know things are hectic and you are very busy, but would you mind getting the detonator onto the charges?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_01_03">Get into docks. There&apos;ll be security, so stay hidden and stay quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_04">Nope. No, that wasn&apos;t right...</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_53_02">Bile dropped some explosives close to your landing spot. Find them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_53_05">That doesn&apos;t sound good! Be ready to fight!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_end_04">That was a real pleasure, makes me think of the old days. Starting out small, the simple things, right? Good work.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_61_any_01">Ten seconds, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_13_01">The drill should be finished soon. I&apos;m trying to get through to my pilot...</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_10w_01">Ok, here comes the tenth wave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_intro_a_03">Vlad is probably right about the police being quick on the draw here. Get in and get out fast after you empty that manager&apos;s safe. And Wolf, stay off the dance floor. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_38_01">Great, the scanning is up and running again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_39_01">There&apos;s the escape! RUN!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_17_01">Come on, clowns - haul ass out of there!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_16_03b">Hey! Clowns! I really want to go home, okay? So please take me to the garage so I can get the stuff I need. Kinda need you to protect me while I work...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_19_01">Check other wagons for extra loot. And C4. Look for that too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_53_02">Let&apos;s salvage what we can. Get the big safe open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_01_01">We&apos;re here for the plates. They&apos;ve been printing fortunes over the last months, spending wildly. Blood&apos;s in the water and we&apos;re the sharks!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_06_03">Time locks are done. Almost there, gang! Open that last door!</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_14_01">Watch for Cloakers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_48_01">Hack the skylight controls to open it. Whatever you do, don&apos;t let the fuzz disable it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_47_02">OK, get him outta there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_17_01">Alright, we&apos;re close. Get him to the top of the tower on your right!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_03_03">One of the packages is in the Jewelry store. Go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_10_01">Good, now hurry back to the gate and open it up, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_53_01">OK, that looks... right? At least it didn&apos;t blow up. Time to mix the next ingredient.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_end_02">I wonder if McKendrick will ever figure out who did this. In any case, he shouldn&apos;t have messed with us.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_end_01_01">Absolutely outstanding work! There&apos;s going to be heads rolling down the corridors of the Pentagon when this train arrives.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_10_03">You&apos;re not going to let a little thing like a wall stand in your way, are you?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_04_01">You can probably access the evidence files from the chief&apos;s computer. I&apos;ll bet it&apos;s on the upper floor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_35_02">Get to the helicopter so we can get the hell out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_14_any_02">Two minutes till escape guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_67_03">They&apos;re going to shoot me down if you don&apos;t hurry! Fighters incoming!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_13_02">Okay, new plan: sneak past that one and find the security room. That way we can disable all cameras at once. </string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_intro_a_01b">I don&apos;t think I need to mention what happens if you get found out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_05_01">Get that box!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_16_03">With the speed this train is going, you&apos;ll have about two minutes before you reach the barricade. That means two minutes to secure everything and leave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_22_02">Our guest loves Ocean&apos;s Ten vodka. Find another blue bottle and spike it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_15_any_09">Go on in, see what we got!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_48_02">Remember to stash that loot in the vents. I got them marked for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_23_03">Clear the pickup zone so Bile can get in there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_63_04">Now make a nice little pile on the floor and burn it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_19_01">You&apos;re through the first truck. Now start cracking boxes and bagging loot. Five bags, so move it, guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_96_02">Why would they put fertilizer behind there? Ach, find a blowtorch or some thing to cut through it with.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_35_01">Get aboard! That was a fucking excellent job, my friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_31_05">If you want to get out you gotta get to that pillar!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_71_02">Stop loitering and get over to the vault!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_20_02">Get to the top of the overpass so Bile can pick you up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_79_02">No standing around, yeah? Kerels are on the way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_04b_02">There has to be a door leading into the mansion.</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_cnc_01">My wife&apos;s brother, that asshole son-of-a-bitch, crashed his plane in the woods just outside the city. I need him and his cargo back here. </string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_03_05">Gang, what&apos;s the hold up? Get inside the building.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_45_02">Thankfully, I have a supply of C4 right here.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap07_01a">My dear guests. My sincere apologies, but we appear to have some crashers of the party, of the very unwelcome kind. I must therefore ask you to make your way to the exits, for your own safety of course.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_04_03">After the truck, gang. Hustle!</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_04_04">Right!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_05_02">These vaults have one weakness. A failsafe will open the door if the temperature inside gets too high. Look around for crowbars in the warehouse, and jam them into the rear fans.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_24_01">Find those security boxes, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_15_01">Gang, you need to find Chavez to get the key. Believe me, you&apos;ll know who he is when you see him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_24_any_08">Fuck me, we needed those cooks. I&apos;m going with chloride.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_07">The police is on our back like a fucking pony tail!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_10_any_01">Come on! Fill the barrels!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_86_04">No time to waste, take the artifact. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_96_01">Blerrie, there&apos;s probably rats in the walls...</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_13_01">Time to go! Help remove moorings from dock!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_47_03">SWAT are rolling in from the east. Get ready, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_20_03">Ok, release!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_09">Oh shiiiiiit!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_166_02">And what would you like as a side? Uh... sausage patties? We got &apos;em!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_07_02">Tread carefully, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_27_05">The drill needs some attention, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_32_02">The C4 is right in there. Why does The Grin need C4? God knows.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_intro_01_01">There&apos;s the bank. Pull over. Keep it cool.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_58_02">You need to find Chloe&apos;s computer.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_11_02">Ok, get to searching for the answer to that code. </string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_82_02">Ach, bunch of keks! They shut down the hack so you need to get it started again.</string>
	 <string id="pt2_cs1_04_01">On my way. Four minutes, tops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_70_01">They&apos;ve no clue you&apos;re there. Now get to that radio.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_29_01">Keep an eye out for Garrett. He won&apos;t be gone forever.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_12_01">Is that... a nuclear warhead!? I... don&apos;t... look, just grab it. Carefully!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_69_01">We&apos;re gonna need two vials. If one of them fails the test, you gotta get more blood and start again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_93_03">You gotta use the thermite on the barrier.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_20_01">That&apos;s the first one, guys. Keep working.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_23_02">Great! Signal the driver that it&apos;s clear.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_58_05">You found it! Time to drill that door!</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_08_03">Cage is right where I put it. Like fucking 633 Squadron!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_95_02">The boat won&apos;t escape the cops&apos; attention forever. Get there, now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_67_02">Why aren&apos;t you drilling that door yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_10_02">Done. The doors are open now friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_40_02">The plane will be picking up the cage from the street. Get it ready.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap02_03">Oh, nothing special. I am just calling to pay my respects.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_11_02">Ok guys, go across the roof!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_18_07">The timer is standing still. Get it going again!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_36_any_01">Another four and we&apos;re done!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_80_01">You need to check the mainframe again for the next artifact.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb2_01_03">Truck&apos;s fucked. I&apos;ll secure a ride out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_90_02">Our friend will show you the way out! Just follow him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_21_01">Just try and sneak past him. Don&apos;t rush it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_02_03">Momma always said it was a big world out there, but this...</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_10_any_03">Guys, I&apos;m waiting for bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_49_any_01">Police snipers, damn it! Now we&apos;re really in for it!</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_03_10">There&apos;s something else alive in here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_51_01">There might be more c4 outside in the stash, friends.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_15">Brace for impact!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_11_02">There! It&apos;s just after the underpass!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_02_03">Let&apos;s see if we can shut the security down. Its weak points are the circuit boxes scattered about. If we can hack them, we can power things down without triggering the alarm.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_07_any_01">I can only take four at a time, fill it up, and I&apos;ll come back for more!f</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_80_03">You need something that can breach that door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_30_03">Check the manager&apos;s office. Look for the IT guys name. Come on, come on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_33_02">Let me see if I can get into their system from here and point you to the right workstation.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_48_01">Use the C4 to send those radars tumbling, my friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_14_02">That&apos;s gas! Get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_04_03">Great. Now get that other keycard working on the opposite gate. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_99_02">Nice! We can shift that, make a little extra dollar.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_84_02">What are you waiting for? Cut the door open!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_18_01">There should be some more ingredients locked up somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_41_01">Come on! Get the time lock going again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_87_04">The Office... you know... the oval one...</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_45_01">You need to figure out which key goes with his car. This would really be easier if we could just take any car.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_73_03">Whoever locked that in there doesn&apos;t want it to fall into hands like ours, so why not bring it along?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_32_03">Use the windows to get rid of any bodies. The sea will swallow them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_38_01">Great! Cutter&apos;s done! Here comes the sweet loot!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_104_02">Attach the car to the chopper so we can lift you out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_23_03">Damn kerels have cut the power. Get it back up and reactivate the crane.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_02_02">To business! There are crates near the entrance. Got a little red strobe on. Find them. They have a few little presents within.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_03_01">You need to get inside the mansion walls. Use the thermite I have supplied you with, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_11_any_04">That noise is pure poison cooking - get the fuck out once you got enough.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_27_03">Up with the balloon! It needs to go higher!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_13_any_01">The pick-up guy is close by, look for the yellow crane.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_33_03">Come on, just get into the fucking boat. Fuck me, what&apos;s wrong with you people?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_15_02">Okay, take a look around and see if you can find one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_39_02">Now make your way back to the car, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_97_03">Make sure you get the right key next time!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_03_02">You need to get to the front!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_16_02b">Let&apos;s get out of here. After you, please...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_14_05">Lost the signal, restart it gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_50_01">Today&apos;s code is 559732. Sorry it took so long.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_03_any_01">I&apos;ll be there in one minute.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_09_any_02">That&apos;s what we need for Hector, if you want to get the rest, that is up to you!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_06_02">I wonder what happened to Mr Pink?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_09_03">Now, the next thing is to get past the security gate so you can access the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_44_03">I&apos;ve found a terminal. Get to it, hack in and we lower that magnetic seal.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_58_02">The alarm has been activated and it&apos;s ticking down. Take care of it before it reaches 0!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_64_any_03">You got to take me out! They&apos;re killing me!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_23_any_01">Hey! The chopper pilot is here! Go go go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_55_01">Set up the detonator.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_10_02">Yep, it&apos;s smoke again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_19_02">We have a zip-line that can help you get loot out of there, nice and quiet. Make sure you use it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_26_01">Alright, got it. Here we go</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_29_any_02">Shutters are down. Only way out is the entrance.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_39_any_03">At least seven more!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_intro_01">Locke never forgets anything!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_93_02">The thermite, friends! Get it onto the barrier.</string>
	 <string id="pln_misc_sj_dgh_03_01">What the hell, guys! You weren&apos;t supposed to kill them now! Wick wanted them alive so he could teach them a lesson... Let&apos;s hope he will be content with the thought of them dead.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_02_02">What... that must be my police scanner, the cops are nowhere near. </string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_47_01">Bring the key to our man!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_08_07">Finish this once and for all!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_58_03">The Butcher&apos;s explosives are in one of these containers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_38_01">He can&apos;t be chop enough to put it on a post-it, could he?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_56_01">BFD needs power - lots of it! Hook her up to a couple of sockets. They&apos;re located inside the casino. Don&apos;t let them get disconnected.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_52_01">Luckily, we were ready for this. Rust told me these Overkill dwankies keep loads of explosives around, so all you gotta do is find some.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_02_03">Two minutes. Hey, fuckface!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_04a_02">Right, now find a way into the mansion.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_17_01">That surprised &apos;em. Now find the Commissar.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_82_02">That red ladder will let you get onto the roof.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_14_01">Those poes fucked the detonator, mans. Fix it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_30_01">Thermite is done. Burned right through that nicely, yeah? Now get going with the winch.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_48_01">Guys! Use the keycard in the dock control room. Get the dock gate open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_02_02">That&apos;s the turret recovered. The driver will be back for the ammo.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_86_03">Reboot the shutdown sequence.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_22_02">Watch out. Snipers are setting up in the area!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_05_01">That truck has our gold. Get after it!</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_03_any_01">So you got nine of the paintings? That&apos;s awesome.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_intro_01_01">He bought it. Fix his leaks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_50_02">You need to distract the cops. Shoot up the store, then get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_60_02">Are you looking for the IT dwankie?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_128_01">Now I need to install some software to scramble the system.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_05_01">Be careful with the cooking, gentlemen.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_10_01">It&apos;s supposed to be hydrogen chloride!</string>
	 <string id="loc_wwh_intro_03">Sorry friends, but it&apos;s time for me to leave, but I&apos;ve left a surprise for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_52_02">Jump down into the hole that the thermite melted through!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_dow_01_01">Well, no turning back now! That was a hell of a bang! Get into that truck and do your part of the job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_02_01">To bypass the security system and get into the vault, patch the devices you have directly into the two control boxes, they should be around there somewhere. Then I&apos;ll hack in remotely and do the rest. </string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_23_01">Yeah, yeah, we got what we came for.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_03_03">All right, that&apos;s the last of the C4. Get down to the garage. Our Inside Man has marked the spot you need to blow.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_45_03">No snoozing, friends. Garrett could be heading back at any time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_23_02">You gotta hold the fort for two minutes until the plane makes the pickup.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_27_any_03">Is it all there? Nice - get what&apos;s yours.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_07_02">Don&apos;t let that gate stop you. I want those boxes searched.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_03_02">That&apos;s all the goats secured. Now get in your car and high tail it out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_22_01">That&apos;s perfect. The cage is assembled.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_73_01">Damn kerels have cut the emergency power lever and stopped the charge. Find it and pull it back, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_58_01">It worked! Great job everyone.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_25_01">Twitch&apos;s truck is ahead. Just drive straight up into the back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_18_01">He should be running out of oxygen soon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_17_01">Use the keycard you picked up to open the door. But, be ready to quickly take out anyone inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_05_03">Just picked up a call to a cop patrol. They&apos;ve been asked to make sure everything&apos;s okay. They&apos;re on their way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_35_01">Did you know I did a tour of the White House once? Blerrie awful furniture, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_24_01">Keep the civilians away from the alarms.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_06_any_05">Don&apos;t throw in any more, it&apos;s full! Wait for me to unload these first.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_01_01">Okay. Do I have everything? Crowbar, zipties, lube. All ready! Gloves on for some really dirty work.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_04d">You know, they might actually...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_63_01">Get to cover!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_15_03b">I think we will come out of this alive after all! Of course, I never doubted it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_19_02">Hook me up to that phone, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_52_01">Boring conversation anyway. Gang, we&apos;re going to have company!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_29_02">Look, do I need to tell you everything. Use the thermal paste to burn through the grate.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_04_07">Here I am, assholes! Over here! Now, over there! Ha, made you look!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_76_03">We have SWAT on the adjacent roofs. Dig them out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_23_01">You&apos;ll probably find a PC in the PR office. </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_28_01">You&apos;ll see a bit of thermal paste down there. Just in case those sewers have any obstructions, you know.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_03_02b">Yeah, yeah, don&apos;t give me that look. I&apos;m not dumb enough to think you just came here to save my life. I know Rust too, remember? And I know he really wants his baby back. Well, you&apos;re gonna have to get me the parts if that&apos;s gonna happen.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_73_01">Ok. Got him. Name, social security number, name of his dog... Find him. Check the screen in IT. Oh, and he&apos;s a slot machine addict, Might be a good place to start looking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_01_02">Now, get to finding that tunnel. The entrance should be fairly accessible. </string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_56a_any_04">I&apos;m moving out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_69_02">Bile can&apos;t get you until you light a flare for him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_58_01">And there goes the escape driver. Keep going. I&apos;ll figure something out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_26_02">Don&apos;t forget the goat in the streetlight. Saw it to bring him down.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_08_08">Bringing west coast safes to my east coast players!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_95_03">We can&apos;t make it work without fertilizer.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_14_01">There&apos;s got to be lot&apos;s of good stuff we can use or sell around here, so keep your eyes peeled for anything that might be good to take along.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_21_01">... take a look outside in the portable toilet at the construction site.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_02_01">Uhh.. Must be my police scanner. I&apos;ll shut it down. The police are miles away.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_intro_01">If we succeed with this, we&apos;ll have the whole criminal underworld talking about it forever. Ladies and gentlemen, this is how you make history.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_02_02">I am watching you, you fucking dickfaces. Eat my shit!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_end_02_02">That was a bit of bloody business, but sometimes it gets like that. Still, job done. Great work!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_18_any_08">Confirmed!</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_04_03">If you kill his guards, you will get to him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_31_02">First, get the drill onto the safe, make a little hole. Then we need to fill the safe with water. The garden hose will do.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_30_01">Now get inside that vault, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_07_01">Grab the raw materials and get them in the house.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_53_02">If you find the server room, we can probably bypass the lock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_39_01">One minute and we&apos;re through!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_01_03">Find that tunnel, friends. They&apos;ve probably got it hidden, but it shouldn&apos;t be too hard to locate.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_38_10">I bet these cops don&apos;t believe in Santa Claus. But I do! And he&apos;s a fucking pain in the ass!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_02_01">Looks like the mobsters are digging in in the rooms. Get in there and wipe every crew member you see. Safeties off.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_82_01">A saw should make quick work of this barrier. See if you can find one.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_01_02">You can&apos;t have Commissar!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_95_02">You have to replace the batteries with fresh ones.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_18_02">And... got it! Storage room is open. Get the keys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_24_04">You have to reconnect the power to the crane system!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_07_08">Wait!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_07_03">It&apos;s time. Put on the masks and let&apos;s do this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_43_any_01">Looks like we&apos;ve hit the jackpot! Bag it up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_48_01">Don&apos;t forget the server!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_08_01">Ah, good. Fuel is moving.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt2_02_02">I&apos;m sending in my brother-in-law. He&apos;ll drop a skyhook cage. If he can avoid crashing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_34_02">Looks like every cop is headed your way! You&apos;re not driving out. Light a flare, and we&apos;ll get you an air extraction.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_03_any_03">We are after the server. Stay out of view guys. Cameras and guards. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_65_04">Don&apos;t stay around longer than you have to... just take it and get out, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_30_any_01">Don&apos;t mess up or get seen now. Almost there...</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_13_03">The EMP has been dropped. Head over just outside the lumber mill and pick it up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_18_03">The safes are way too heavy to carry, and those trucks are screwed. Gonna need another transport. I&apos;ll find something - hang tight.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_51_02">Get cracking now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_89_01">Is the drill up again?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_19_01">He saw you! Deal with it!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_16_03b">What a messy situation. Let&apos;s get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_end_01_03">Ninja&apos;s in socks tiptoeing on thick carpet make more noise than you. Expertly done!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_86_02">Hurry friends, get the artifact!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_17_02">All right, with that taken care of it&apos;s time to find the server room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_34_02">That&apos;s the coke, gang. I knew you would do it! Now bag it.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_16_03">Sorry...slight miscalculation. I&apos;m going to come around and try again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_81_02">Hack the ship control terminal!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_03_03">Your first job is getting beyond the perimeter.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_19_03">Try that print on the safe and see if it works, yeah? Then get the key.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_14_any_01">Come on! Fill the barrels!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_13_02">I&apos;m sending the helicopter, keep bagging the stuff!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_01_03">If you can get through this quietly, you should be able to just melt away with the crowd.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_01_01">Damn, looks like the cops had been staking the place. Move it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_08_03">Might be a good to at least get some extra funding out of this, so go find that saw, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_46_01">Search those bags of coke, guys.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_31_01">This is the one! Let&apos;s go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_intro_a_02">This is the gallery.  You&apos;re looking for the paintings marked by a red sold sticker. We need at least four to make this work. The place is closed and locked down. Find a way in. Go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_47_01">No dossing about, yeah? Get inside the mansion.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_66_02">That&apos;s the plane we&apos;re looking for. Get the loot inside, then give it some fuel.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_05a_any_02">I&apos;ll be there in two...</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_brief_02">OK, you&apos;re  in position at the trainyard. Eyes open. Watch for suits. I can&apos;t see any active vehicles nearby but that doesn&apos;t mean much. Go to the train car and wait for contact.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_24_03">Good night snipers! Good job, guys. Now, time to get that C4.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_45_01">That&apos;s the head of security. He seems to be by the driveway.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_22_01">Nicely done. Now get into that office, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_79_02">Yes! I got the - no, wait. Can&apos;t be. Damn. Almost had it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_49_02">It&apos;s a trap! Either you defuse these C4s or you get the hell outta there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_05_03">Keep freeing the Butcher&apos;s people.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_13b_01">You gotta wonder who comes up with a name like that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_15_03">Chopper will be over the wrecked plane any second.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_79_01">Grab the artifact, make sure that the kerels don&apos;t get their hands on it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_15_01">And that&apos;s the second. Oh, I can smell the wealth! But greed is good, yeah. For sure. Find the third pallet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_14_any_01">Great! Now get them up to the station on the roof and connect them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_28_01">Look at this place. Makes me wish we could heist a whole building.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_01_02">There are metal detectors all around the entrance, you&apos;ll need to get around them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_01_01">We&apos;re doing this nice and quiet. The computer we&apos;re looking for should be located on the second floor. </string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_05_any_02">That&apos;s the address! We&apos;ve got what we need. Get back to the van and we can get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_07_any_01">Now, torch the money...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_19_02">There&apos;s a security office close by. Just in case you want to get rid of any surveillance.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_27_02">You&apos;ve just etched your names into history, gang. Heisters will tell this story for generations.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_60_02">Looks like there might be an underground vault somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_12_any_01">Good, good. This&apos;ll make our lives easier when we hit the Democrat...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_55_01">The cops are in control of the vault doors. They will open any second - be ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_43_02">Get the bags to the window-washing platform.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_10_03">Go to the computer, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_01_03">No time to waste. Get in there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_40_02">Need the Moretta&apos;s frequency, guys. Get searching terminals.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_07_02">Check through windows. See if you can find the alarm box. Once you go in, it&apos;s gonna go off pretty quick, so be ready.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_29_02">Nice work guys! Grab me a burger while you&apos;re at it. See ya back at the warehouse!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage3_09_any_01">Chopper is there, throw the bags into the chopper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_23_02">Good find. That will certainly do.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_31_02">Answer the phone!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_08_03">The facility changes very often, so what little I saw when I was there can&apos;t be relied on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_intro_01_01">Get the Moretta out of the dock. When it&apos;s berth, get aboard, get the explosives, get out. Got it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_36_any_03">OK, chopper is coming in to pick up that Fusion Engine.</string>

	 <string id="loc_bex_75_03">We need the square cleared, chop chop!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_74_01">Security is still quiet. Now find the bomb.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_10_01">That&apos;s it for the fans. Temperature is spiking fast. What the hell is in there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_55_01">Great work. Now, let&apos;s see if the big fish will bite...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_15_02">Looks like we got the shitty end of the stick. The vault&apos;s empty! Get out of there, now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_167_01">All yours for the price of... say... 18 bucks.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_16_01">You have to destroy that evidence!</string>
	 <string id="crn_man_00_03">Like an arm stretching out from the heavens, I&apos;m picking that limo up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_49_04">Hey boss, the guys in Mexico sent you some tequila. You want it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_65_03">You need to find those routers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_cbf_01_03">Gensec&apos;s overland armored convoys employ a lot of ex-military types, providing firepower and muscle, and they move everything from little Jimmy&apos;s favorite baseball card to the Crown Jewels. We got a line on a convoy moving into D.C. Let&apos;s see what we can get.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_13_02">There, now it&apos;s time to blow a big hole in that antique floor, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_41_any_01">Get the power back up!</string>
	 <string id="plt_flt_07_03">I&apos;m here, guys, but I can&apos;t come closer as long as the roof is filled with cops.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_70_01">Hit the button, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_36_01">An active ECM jammer will probably make it hard to open the server room security door. Keep that in mind.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_61_02">I&apos;m sure he will reason after that, right? Ready to move in, team.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_53_03">Got those sentry guns set up yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_16_any_01">Cash time. Bag it!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_24_any_08">We got twelve!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_40_04">You almost got that winch ready?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_41_02">OK, now you can take all of Vlad&apos;s special loot, but don&apos;t make too much noise.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_103_01">You took care of both guards. Don&apos;t have to worry about the cameras anymore.</string>
	 <string id="csf_cs1_01_01">I need to talk to someone about my 401k.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_52_04">You should be looking for recipes friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_75_01">Gang, that&apos;s a heavy SWAT van that just rocked up. Be ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_48_any_05">They&apos;re calling in snipers. Too many civilians casualties.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_77_02">We gotta get past that gate. Look around and see if you can find something useful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_15_01">If we&apos;re gonna get into the boss&apos; office, we need to open the rest of the house. Look for a switch or something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_end_a_01">The Elephant will be very excited. That&apos;s his campaign funding by big oil until 2050 right there. Very professional, folks.</string>

	 <string id="pln_mad_56_01">That radar needs to be taken down somehow. See if you can use the anti-air gun to blow it up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_19_02">You&apos;re spotted! Fix this.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_18_02">Got my file. Let&apos;s see what they have on me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_27_01">Good job, but we need some more on the fourth floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_01_02">Get into the store, you know what to do! Let&apos;s get those jewels.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_05_03">Crack open the back door with a saw and go through there, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_60_any_04">30 seconds more and I&apos;m out!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_57_any_01">The heat&apos;s rising!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_101_02">Just hold them off a little longer, gang. I&apos;m finding you a way out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_16_any_01">Hurry down guys. We don&apos;t want the police to wreck our ticket for escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_16_03">Our chopper will be over the train yard in a moment. Get ready!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_123_01">Kakspul! It&apos;s doing an auto-update! Get to the mainframe and stop it!</string>

	 <string id="loc_pex_48_03">Don&apos;t dally with the key now!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_20">I hope this hunk o&apos; metal has air bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_end_a_03">You guys know who Tucker is? I hope you don&apos;t. Great work back there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_83_03">Keep looking for a saw!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_09_04">Find the saw guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_39_03">Great, now get out of there while you can.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_02_01">Look for the cases, break them and bag the jewels.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_15_03">We can&apos;t proceed until you have the keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_49_03">Time is ticking, gang. You have to move the loot to the container to secure it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_114_03">BFD&apos;s guzzled a whole coolant tank already. Fill her glass, gang. Bathroom&apos;s have water.</string>

	 <string id="loc_des_21_03">Hurry up friends, go out there and start the crane.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_35_03">Look for clues connected to the Commissioner&apos;s wife.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_38_02">You have everything to you need to open the vault. Keycard first, then enter the code.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_02_02">Ok, I&apos;ll circle around for a bit. I&apos;ll be ready when I&apos;m needed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_63_03">That&apos;s it. Now haul those parts out of there.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_05_01">Shite! Small problem - server&apos;s heavily encrypted. The encryption keys are kept in the Security Office. You need to grab them and bring them back here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_92_01">Get to the chopper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_29_01">Ok, let&apos;s get some loot while we&apos;re here. Ernesto has a floor safe in his office. There are some winches near the driveway where you entered - grab them and hook them up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_10_01">What the... Another one? Guys, there&apos;s another switchbox, rewire that one too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_16_02">Ok, now for the server room... That laptop you found earlier should enable me to give you access. Go back there and hook me up.</string>

	 <string id="loc_fex_35_04">Remember friends, get to the office.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_17_02">You gotta restart the override.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_40_02">Oh, if we could take that thing out and sell it... but we just got to open it. Those symbols are the key. Look around for some clues, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_78_01">Now get inside that vault, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_01_02">One minute. So close.</string>

	 <string id="plt_flt_09_02">That&apos;s good enough. Coming in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_78_01">Damn thing keeps stopping. I gotta override the system. It&apos;ll be a while until it reaches you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_63_02">Now hurry into the office! Watch for kerels!!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_75_02">Did you find the armory yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_plan_b">I&apos;ll get you out of there. Just keep the loot safe!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_01_any_01">The convoy&apos;s stopped, move toward the bus.</string>

	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_06">We&apos;re gonna fucking crash!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_02_03">Get looking through the records. Find those testimonies.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_end_loud_02">Not exactly textbook perfection, but who cares when it all works out! </string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_03_04">Where&apos;s that laptop? Found it yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_49_01">Time to get what we came here for, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_92_01">Let&apos;s see... we&apos;ll need fertilizer, diesel, wires and some kind of timer. See what you can find.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_34_01">Great work! A classic takedown of a classic heist. It was a pleasure to watch!</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_03_any_01">Halfway mark. Hurry up!</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_28_02">Hey, I&apos;m not gonna be able to break out of here without some help.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cs1_10_03">Just took a fucking .50 cal. Fuck! I&apos;m going down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_cro_01_01">I knew we could trust that sniper! He delivers. Don&apos;t waste time - get to work on that transport!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_41_02">Gang, we&apos;re going nowhere until that drill is working.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_05_03">Rat! Time locks have kicked in. Alright. Forget keycards. We&apos;re going to force this.</string>

	 <string id="loc_pex_29_01">Get that door breaker in position!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_30_01">Jesus, that&apos;s nasty. Well, you got what we need. Place it on the scanner, I guess?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_21_02">That&apos;s it! Get the code to the panic room!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_02_03">I contact you with instructions when I am back on ship.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_38_02">Get a drill up, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_50_any_03">Roof, Roof! Blackhawk on the roof!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_21_02">Use the crane to get the artifact, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_34_01">The mainframe, gang. Get to it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_72_01">Kerels have stopped the computer, you gotta restart the hack!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_cnc_01_01">We got Gensec trucks moving through the suburbs. Go hit &apos;em.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_19_03">I&apos;m still looking. Damn, LA is smoked. Hold them off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_01_01">This is it. Pull over.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_16_02">Ship is being attacked. Defend and remove gangways!</string>

	 <string id="loc_bex_81_01">Now collect those bags, and get to assembling the Beast! </string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_104_01">We need that vault open. Quiet with keycards, or bust it open with a drill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_21_03">Look right outside the Glitter Room for one of the PCs. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_10_01">They cut the power! Get it back up or we can&apos;t continue the download.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_05_02">Close down on that truck. Get that gold!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_104_02">This is it, gang. They&apos;re throwing everything they have in to this. Get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_74_07">The lever. Find it and pull.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_69_03">Get the power back on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_98_01">Grab it and there&apos;ll be a nice bonus.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_110_02">Use ziplines if you want to speed it up.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_10_02">Pick up some precious stones for me!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_36_02">Great guys! Look at that! Grab all that you can before you escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_92_02">Chopper&apos;s waiting for you. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_09_any_01">Let&apos;s do this faster, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_intro_02_01">Our man is in position, and the target just turned on to McCarty. Almost there. Almost there...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_96_02">We got roadblocks on the perimeter, and cops closing the net. No way out by the road. Time for a new plan.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_14_02">Now, hack into a workstation terminal.</string>
	 <string id="csm_cs1_02_01">Hey, I&apos;m having trouble with my account on the computer. Do I internet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_intro_02_02">What do you want?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_36_02">Get into the chopper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_34_02">That&apos;s the second. One more.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_64_any_02">Help! HELP!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_09_01">Go to the panic room, it&apos;s on the third floor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_04_02">Damn, they&apos;ve upgraded to the Mark 7 detectors. Going to be a bit more difficult.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_100_01">Use that blowtorch you got a while back, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_34_01">Find the control box!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_41_02">This is the first control room for the gate. Other one is over the way there, see?</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_08_any_02">Check the backrooms.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_01_01">And who do we have here? I don&apos;t know you. I don&apos;t know who sent you. Is this really how you wanna play?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_83_03">Switch that terminal back on, gang. Let&apos;s get this ship moved.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_98_03">Get him the right car key!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_19_03">The street is where we need to assemble the cage. Move it!</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_05_01">I see the drop zone. Putting the cage by the silo.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_38_05">There might be uniforms in the locker room!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_05_05">Find that computer.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_18_04">Something&apos;s burning y&apos;all and it doesn&apos;t smell like no Texas bbq i&apos;ve ever had. Put that fire out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_03_01">We need a keycard to get into the prison. But where can we get one?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_12_11">No... that wasn&apos;t right, was it?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_78_01">Here&apos;s one of the things you need.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_50_02">Ah, here we are. Right in front of me. 674523.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_09_any_04">Don&apos;t let them get close!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_13_03">The old drunk is on the ground again. Get him to his feet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_47_02">Looks like the EMP isn&apos;t here, but there might be some other valuable loot for us. You can either check it now or come back later.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_48a_01">Ok, one firewall down. Get to the next.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_07_03">The machine&apos;s done. That should make The Elephant happy. Now close up the crate and keep going.</string>
	 <string id="bru_run_04_03">On my way, boss!</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_09_01">That&apos;s some fine loot they stashed in there, but it&apos;s ours now. How do we get it out?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_30_02">Great. Now wait. That rat will be ours soon.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_101_02">Alright, plan B is the helicopter. Hang on...</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_11_01">Too slow, guys. Go back and try again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_24_01">That&apos;s enough. Now put a gas can on it and shoot it to light it up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_64_01">Aim the weapon, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_02_02">Hey guys, remember to find the crates Locke has left. They got a strobe on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_55_06">Time to pull out gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_108_02">And... great! There&apos;s the top of the vault!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_03_04">By the barbecue. That&apos;s our man.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_60_04">Kerels aren&apos;t going to stop coming, so get out of there, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_01_any_02">The Mendozas are down there. Cut that fence and get those guns.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_intro_01">Friends, I know this is serious but you still have to have a bit of fun, yeah? Watch now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_09_02">You&apos;re in. Now hunt down keycards - two of &apos;em. I&apos;d guess offices are your best bet. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_13_02">Come on friends, we have a schedule to keep.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_22_02b">Yo! What the fuck! I can&apos;t work if I have these cops right in my fucking face!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_19_01">Don&apos;t go near the neighbours houses.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_21_02">You still need to find something we can use to get through those bars.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_131_01">Seven</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_23_03">Use the crane to lift the gold container onto the truck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_30_01">Thats your way out of here! To the right and down the stairs, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_05_03">Now we gotta get into the mansion. Won&apos;t be easy. Expect doors and windows to be alarmed. Need to figure that out.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_03_02">This is it. Right, I need to get on those servers. Clear the room!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_04_03">Left? Right? Where to go? I dont know! Hahahah!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_76_01">Times like these, I always wonder; What kind of person writes elevator music, eh?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_79_08">Damn, did the Commissar bring this piece of crap from the Motherland? </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_20_03">Still need to get that safe open. Use the print.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_77_01">C&apos;mon guys, get that guy to the roof.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_02_02">I know they say it&apos;s bad luck to hit Santa, but you&apos;ve got to wake him up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_07_01">Get a code breaker on that lock, too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_02_03">Vlad&apos;s pretty upset about these safes. Wants to talk to you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_95_01">Got it! The casino manager&apos;s code.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_80_01">Not the best drop, but good enough, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_12_02">That can&apos;t be... a goddamn nuke!? Vlad! </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_55_01">Ah, you got it wrong. Maybe bringing hazmat suits would have been a good idea. Wait until it stops reacting, then try again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_14_any_02">Factory, cops in numbers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_74_03">Get into the elevator with the box. Twitch is waiting for you in the basement.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_06_01">Connect hose to ship, now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_60_01">Where&apos;s the IT guy? They&apos;re always hiding when you need them, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="csk_cs1_01_01">Is my dad there? Mr Hunt. First name (disconnects)</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_104_03">Pick up the keycard so we can get to the next part!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_19_any_02">Good job keeping it together in a tight spot! Now hustle to the docks!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_11_03">What the hell is that? An enormous toothbrush? I could really use something like that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_08_03">There goes the chopper, but don&apos;t worry - it&apos;ll be back. In the meantime, let&apos;s see if you can track down some more of those presents.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_02_02">Tackle ready?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_04_any_01">The arms deal guys... We got to get that deal exposed in the media and fast. It will create a framing effect for sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_46_02">The elevator shaft is open. That&apos;s the path to the van. Start hauling.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_11_01">The evidence storage should be on the second floor, find it and use the key tag to get in. </string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_17_any_07">I have to leave!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_51_01">The keypad has been disabled! You&apos;re going to have to blow your way in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_41_any_02">A civilian called 911.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_64_01">Just heard they&apos;ve got a squad of bulldozers up in the area ahead. They&apos;ll fuck us in the ass. I don&apos;t want that. Watch it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_62_01">You do the shooting, my friends, I&apos;ll just blend in a bit with my Murky Uniform. Don&apos;t get me mixed up, okay?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_47_02">Ah, kak. He&apos;s in his office again. We&apos;ve got to get him out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_64_03">Time to leave the PEOC.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_08_02">Get her down from there, guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_58_10">Don&apos;t worry about all the bodies. We have... a facility.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_07a_any_01">There in 30 seconds...</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_16_01">Two.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_19_03">Great work, gang! Found another closet.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_59_01">Good, now grab that box and get out before whatever that thing is in the tank wakes up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_04_01">There it is.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_04_any_04">I can only take three at a time...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_23_01">Murky bliksems have cut the power to the crane. You gotta get it going again, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_90_03">The code begins with a nine, according to my source.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_07_01">Got a line on that road. That&apos;s where your cage will be!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_99_03">You&apos;ll be needing that torch later for sure!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_34_02">I&apos;m waiting for you. Keep driving that boat to me.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_66_03">Alright, it&apos;s time to get into the auctioneer&apos;s office so you can find the code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_23_01">Pretty sure there will be a goat inside the store. Get a drill on the door!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_95_02">You need that fertilizer!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_64_02">What... that&apos;s what the Elephant had? Isn&apos;t that... No, not quite eh? Just take it and get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_80_01">Now you gotta clear the runway by blowing the gates!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_52_any_03">More loot than I expected. Good work!</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_03_03">What is it with some men and cars? Nevermind, you are in now. Kill him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_46_02">Set off the fireworks. Stand back. Stay safe.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_05_07b">Holy fuck!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_72_02">You have to restart the charge.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_22_02">Alright, I&apos;m wrapping up in here, almost done. There&apos;ll be lots of info to sort through. But we&apos;re going to find that arsehole. Silence him before he squeals.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_22_02">Looks like those patrolmen have been missed. We got responders coming in force. Get ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_42_02">We need to get the water running again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_33_01">OK. Any... Second...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_07_01">Think it&apos;s almost there... Hang on... Wait... fuck! It crashed again. Get it rebooted.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_39_02">Leave the tree alone! I like it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_103_02">You&apos;ve got tear gas incoming! Stay away from it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_25_01">Well done, Dallas. Head to the van and get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_74_03">Can&apos;t do anything without power!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_97_01">Lets see what we have here.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_08_03">There! Fuel is now filling in boat.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_16_01">There you go. Nicely done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_16_03">That&apos;s all the cash secured. Now for the server with the bank passwords - get back to that laptop and hook me up so I can open the server room&apos;s security lock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_20_02">A helicopter is approaching. Damn, they&apos;ll see Alex! </string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_17_any_01">That&apos;s five bags!</string>
	 <string id="pt2_cs1_02_03">A roof pick-up? That&apos;s a bad approach, Sensei.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_12_01">They sure like messing with the power. Keep an eye on those breakers. Prevent them from interrupting the download.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_159_03">Can I ask if you are having a good day, sir?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_19_02">Check just outside the Jade Room. There&apos;s a PC monitor on there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_15_03">Look in the boxes, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_128_02">Four!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_10_01">That&apos;s it! Now put all the goats in it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_08_02">Boom!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_04_02">Hmmm, couple of timelocks. Alright, you&apos;re gonna need keycards to go through. These rent-a-cop security won&apos;t have them, but I am sure the civilian researchers will. Get them to give those cards up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_03_01">Oh man, he&apos;s really drunk! Gonna be tricky to escort that guy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_10_02">Take cover!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_61_any_02">Ten seconds now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_111_02">Ah! The cage was empty. Did you let the cops snag it back? Nevermind. You guys are just gonna have to mule it out the old-fashioned way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_cps_01c">That&apos;s right, no survivors. I need the area cleared and no questions asked. Understand?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_80_03">Time to find a way in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_04_any_03">We don&apos;t have enough paintings yet! Can someone get me access to the computer in the surveillance room, fast? I&apos;ll get it open, don&apos;t you worry about your pretty little heads.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_76_01">Locked. OK, look around for clues to the code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_43_02">Good. Your ride is coming down now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_93_01">Bile is waiting for you!</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_07_01">Watch out, friends. LMG Dozers are coming!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_55_05">No time for snacks. Get out, ASAP.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_29_03">Pick up the phone and let me do the talking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_09_02">Wait... hmm... this system is more advanced than I thought. There should be a security switchboard somewhere - you gotta find it and rewire it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_21_03">The secondary servers should overheat if you turn off the flow of coolant.</string>
	 <string id="plt_as1_04_02">I see the flare! I&apos;m coming in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_58_03">Now turn on BFD. They&apos;ll display her for years to come.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_28_03">C4&apos;s all done. Now let&apos;s blow the gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_63_03">All that printing press needs is paper and ink. Cha-ching! Instant cash!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_02_03">A keycard for the gate. Gonna need another, though.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_20">Run like you mean it! Just kill whoever&apos;s in you way, don&apos;t waste time and bullets on anyone else!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_23_01">That should do it. They&apos;ll overheat now and cause that reboot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_11_any_02">We have four now and four&apos;s what we need - now if you want to get more, your move.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_136_01">What are you waiting for? Grab all the pardons!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_47_02">I&apos;d get that second vault open if I were you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_11_01">Nice catch! You are ready for this!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_12_03">You need to find keycards. My guess is that the buildings are your best chance.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_38_02">Do as you&apos;re told, goddamn it! I can shut down every airport for a thousand miles and have you ditched in the ocean, you spineless turd. Over.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_28_01">Plant the C4 and blow the roof off.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_78_02">There... that looks useful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_94_02">Be ready for a smash-and-grab!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_12_01">Ok, I&apos;m inside - but it seems the elevator isn&apos;t working. Listen - I need to get something important that they took from me. It&apos;s in a metal briefcase. Can you get it for me?</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_32_any_01">They&apos;re on the roof!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_115_03">I know this vault type... we can&apos;t just crack it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_36_03">Should stay running for a bit, now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_35_03a">Why not go back and get some of that juicy loot? I&apos;ll make it worth your time.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_33_any_01">Just one to go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_19_03">Time&apos;s being wasted, restart the hack.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_113_02">Great. Now turn her back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_08_any_01">OK, the escape helicopter is coming - hold on!</string>
	 <string id="plt_flt_14_02">Got it! I&apos;m off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_23_01">Let&apos;s start moving those money bags to the cage, gang. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_28_01">We&apos;ve all three digits we need for the vault. Get there and enter the code.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_10_09">Don&apos;t mess it up now. Time to hit it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_29_01">Blerrie, wrong code! There goes the neighborhood!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_112_01">With any luck, the Murkys will not follow you. This tunnel is said to be able to withstand a couple nukes. </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_104_02">Use the crane to get the crate, friends.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_05_02">How much are you being paid? I have counteroffer. Fuck all! Hahahaha!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_39_02">Yes, that&apos;s right, all of you up the shaft, please.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_02_03">The bastards called in the SWAT-team! Give &apos;em hell!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_63_02">Welcome to Mexico, dear amigos. No time to waste!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_brief_02b">A little bird told me the Mendozas are flying in more weapons in preparation for the war with Hector.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_31_03">To the pillar guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_02_02">Keep moving and don&apos;t play around. You trigger the alarm, we&apos;re screwed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_50_02">Keep at it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_70_04">You&apos;ve got to relight the fire!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_09_01">Who knows what&apos;s on that server. Blueprints, records - maybe the password for Area 51.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_05d">All things considered, I&apos;d rather be going back to Vegas.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_01_01">There&apos;ll be a couple of keycards out there, maybe in the trunks of cars. They&apos;ll help you get silent access to the vault. Or you can forget that Mission Impossible crap and unleash Ragnarok. Up to you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_21_02">There are bandit barriers in the bank. Shut &apos;em from the security office. They&apos;ll help keep cops out of your way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_125_01">Now what? A bluescreen? Dwankie computers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_65_02">You can&apos;t stay there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_12_01">I bet the mad dictator ate off those silver plates.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_82_01">...And don&apos;t forget to get the boxes off the conveyor!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_70_01">Halfway there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_42_01">The building is opening up like a swiss cheese! I suggest you go up a few floors to get a better tactical position.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_21_01">Okay. Now get it over by our exit. Use the control panel.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_07_02">The vault has gotta be there, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_end_04_01">This will forever be a Red Letter day for the criminal community. The day the Payday Gang broke the Benevolent.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_34_01">As expected, they&apos;ve got helicopters. A smokescreen will force them away.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_20_03">You guys are great! I&apos;m your number one fan!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_35_01">He&apos;d better hold on tight. It&apos;d be a shame if he fell out of the sky and died.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_49_03">Them keycards open the dock gates. Use one in each control room. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_14_01">You can secure the bags down in the motorboat or throw them in the sea and we&apos;ll pick them up later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_16_any_02">Guys we&apos;re looking for a tiara, might be in a safe, gotta be inside though.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_61_01">Shooters on the roof. Watch out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_112_03">OK, that computer had a piece of code to the vault on it, but to be able to use it, you need the other parts as well. They&apos;re probably around there somewhere. </string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_29_02">That&apos;s it, just the fifth floor left.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_10_02">These jewels will be easy to shift. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_12_01">Ok, the computer is working nice and steady again, hacking the system.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_92_03">Let me repeat</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_109_01">You need to keep an eye on that cage. The cops can lift the bags right out of there.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_07_any_02">Hang tight till I come back for another round!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_67_02">Great now we just gotta turn the computer back on too.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb2_01_02">That&apos;s it for the truck. I&apos;ll find more wheels.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_17_02">Rewire those circuits. That should reset the time lock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_cnc_02">Someone&apos;s tipped the cops off about suspicious activity at the Safe House!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fourstores_stage1_end_a_01">Nice guys. Sneaky and still sent a message. They lost the dough and Vlad will be sure to point out to them you are on his team.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_depositbox_a_intro_a_02">Got a deposit box opportunity in this bank. I have inside info.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_77_02">Don&apos;t forget that smoke signal, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_50_03">Blimp is over the city and headed for you. Give it a moment.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_46_03">Murkys are still patrolling, so keep a lookout.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_18_03">If you patch me into a phone, I can try to give the dear Commissioner something to do elsewhere. </string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_04_03">Yeah-yeah-yeah... Run the plan!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_18_02">Get the keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage2_03_any_01">Go to the apartment and get what we came here for.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_59_02">And now we wait for the vault timelock to run down. This is a secured site, you know.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_02_01">There&apos;s the house. And, somewhere in there, the rat.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_54_01">It should be on the bottom floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_09_03">Good job boys. That&apos;s enough to call this one a success.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_02_01b">Thank fucking god you&apos;re here! These bastards were going to kill me, and for what? I just came here to get the bike... Jesus Christ...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_105_03">The bypass needs to be restarted.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_23_02">They&apos;ve got a PR office here. Maybe we should have one of those. They probably have a laptop. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_29_03">The lead scientist is dead? Shit. Without him we aren&apos;t getting past security... Well, I guess technically we don&apos;t need HIM, but rather HIS hand...</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_56_02">Hah, he had it coming.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_15_02">Good job. You reacted fast. Time to dispose of the bodies.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_10_03">Plan B is much like Plan A - keep hacking. A little bit of code at my end and it will look like we were doing this for Mayor Nancy. So keep hacking those machines!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_02_to_arrival">Two minutes until you can get the hell out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_09_03">Don&apos;t let yourself get pinned down! Move!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_01_any_03">This is the boat. You guys aren&apos;t exactly subtle. I&apos;m coming in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_38_01">Guys, the lance is out there. Go get it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_49_02">Hey boss, got a package for you here. It&apos;s from the HQ in Bolivia.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_19_02">Damn, I almost had his location. Definitely near the centre. Keep at it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_16_any_01">You guys are looking for a necklace, remember?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_18_05">The timer stopped! Restart it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_01e">All things considered, I&apos;d rather be going back to Vegas.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_48_02">The Commissar is bunkered down somewhere around Foggy Bottom. Find a clue for that place.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_13_01">Great job! I&apos;m sending the helicopter, keep looting!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_23_02">You know, my old grandmother used to hide Krugerrand behind the light fixtures....</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_64_02">Standard response is to get a strong line of armor in there, so expect bulldozers up ahead. Get ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_06_01">Damn, this gold was likely boosted from Saddam&apos;s palace!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_17_01">That should be the last door. Almost there, almost there...!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_101_01">Time for plan B. I have a helicopter standing by... we&apos;ll lift you out, car and everything.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_21_03">The door appears to be locked from the outside. Look around and see if you can find another way to get out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_66_02">Got that lighting fluid yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_72_01">All gone! Now let&apos;s go get our friend out. He should be close by.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_park_marksmen_building_02">They&apos;re taking up positions in a nearby building... Keep your eyes open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_26_08">You wouldn&apos;t believe such a dump could exist in the heart of our nation.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_06_02">It&apos;s going to take me a while to shut this down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_19_03">Ok, get the goods!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_cnc_01_02">There is a jewelry store downtown that just recieved a shipment. You up for a smash and grab?</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_09_01">I&apos;ll eavesdrop, relaying...</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_19_01">You&apos;re getaway is all ready. There&apos;s a bridge just down the road, and Twitch is on the other side, with a truck. Just drive right up into the truck and we are done!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_regular_a_intro_a_03">Guys this bank just seems right. Don&apos;t know the load but it should be big.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_39_any_03">Once here I will have it verified. Stay put. </string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_47_any_01">Whatever you do don&apos;t let the sons of bitches cut the power!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_116_03">We&apos;ve gotta hack it. Patch me into the PEOC mainframe, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_94_02">Did you check the wine cellar for fertilizer?</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_08_02">Handle that stuff with great care.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_27_02">Open the vault with the code on the screen.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_intro_02">It&apos;s Matt Roscoe! Don&apos;t let him get away! Maybe you should just kill him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_100_03">Use ziplines to get the bags out via the garden.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_45_01">Blerrie, you triggered the metal detectors!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_06_02">Looks like one of our machines. Start the hack, and then keep the feds off it. </string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_53_03">I think the stealth plan just got modified.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_32_any_03">Don&apos;t pass out, the place is loaded with loot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_35_02">That bought you some time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_67_02">This will be a high-profile catch if the cops drop us. Don&apos;t let it happen.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_02_03">That&apos;s volatile stuff. Try and get it out, but don&apos;t lose sight of the goal.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_59_03">Splendid, friends. Now maybe I can brute-force it.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_05_01">Good job. Ernesto Sosa is dead. My point has been made.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_70_01">That should be enough to kick the Murkys in the teeth.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_34_03">Right, now memorize that code, chop chop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_29_any_04">Damn it! I lost power to the server! Get it back up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_39_01">Quiet... Quiet. You&apos;re doing great.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_77_02">Good job assembling the cage. Can you do as good filling it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_intro_01_02">The transport is stopped! Open it, bag the loot, escape. Simple.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_23_any_02">OK! Chopper&apos;s here! Go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_51_02">We&apos;re almost done, but may I remind you again about bringing the bags to the helicopter?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_46_any_03">Well done. Get into the chopper and lets go get our payday.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_gold_a_intro_a_05">People I think this job is a gold mine. Almost literally. </string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_09_any_06">Is this the fastest you can be!?</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_15_03">And....got it! Guys, I got it! Sometimes I amaze even myself.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_05f">You might not want to know the answer to that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_10_02">Both routers hacked. Almost too easy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_49_01">Get those gates open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_06_03">To get inside the Oval Office, you gotta go through the access point in the West Wing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_33_03">Crap, that&apos;s the alarm. Alright, gang - time to go loud.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_36_04">Are you having problems?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_35_03">It&apos;s made of metal and plastic, but this server has secrets that makes Pandora&apos;s Box look like a fucking kiddies toy-chest.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_09a_02">Right, now let me just get this sorted. Will be done in a jiffy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_42_any_03">Fusion reaction is confirmed - all good and green. You guys skip out of there !</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_16_06">I&apos;ll be goddamned fucked. That pyro display was some sorry sack of shit.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_end_a_02">Well you didn&apos;t get any of the money but the important part is done. The art was delivered and the senator can look at his paintings in peace... For a little while. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_45_02">Don&apos;t forget that Garrett will be back soon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_04_05">Okay gang. Watch your step. The neighbours will have the cops on speed-dial.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_14_03">Logged in. Alright, I&apos;ll have that lock open soon. Head back to the van and grab the C4. Might as well get the escape ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_46_01">Everybody, get down into the sewers!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_80_02">Can&apos;t leave while the garage doors are closed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_16_any_01">That&apos;s the doors, they blocked off the doors! There&apos;s gotta be another way out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_69_03">Hurry, friends. Get into the chopper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_37_01">Grab that C4, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_05_03">Great, lets take a peek under the hood. Hmmm, nice. Good security, but nothing I can&apos;t handle.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_15_01">Find the main breaker and cut the electricity. That should prompt him to come have a look, so you can get to him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_48_01">Maybe killing the lights will do it. Have a look around for a circuit box.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_85_02">You need to restart the saw.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_26_02">You would think the feds would&apos;ve found this place and cleared it out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_12_02">You gotta find that safe, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_05">Son of a bitch!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_09_01">Reckon the best place for the guys to build the cage is on the road.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_60_03">Can&apos;t get the code without the keycard. Find the auctioneer!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_66_01">One router down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_02_any_01">There&apos;s probably some gasoline or detergent somewhere that can be lit on fire.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_03_06">Keep going forward!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_39_01">You can use the crowbar to open up shipping crates.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_65_02">The boat can&apos;t wait forever, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_68_03">Cop just entered the bank. Don&apos;t let him get the wrong idea.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_54_03">You got the explosives? Great. Get over to the radar and plant them so we can blow it up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_33_01">You&apos;ll have to raise the balloon again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_15_02">Ka-boom! That was on the bullseye, yes. Fight your way in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_fixed_heli">Guys, I&apos;ve secured a chopper to get you out. Stay put!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_27_any_11">15 bags!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_12_01">Check roofs, buildings, car parks - all those kinds of places. That pallet is around there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_38_02">Fellas, fetch the lance!</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_01_03">Yeah-yeah-yeah... Run the plan!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_37_02">I think the box is behind that vault door, so get a drill on it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_02_02">Get that open, and get whatever is in there!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_28_any_12">We got 16!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_15_01">Halfway there. Some weird traffic coming across the network.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_110_03">No more party people, they&apos;re all heading out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_01_03">No broken legs? Good. Head into the forest and find that plane. My guess is the pilot will be nearby. Get him someplace safe and we&apos;ll evac him by air. Move out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_end_c_01">Damn. We don&apos;t have enough product to trade, which means we&apos;re in a tough spot. Let&apos;s keep it quiet and go to Hector. We&apos;ll see how it goes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_26_03">Hustle! The murkies will notice that open vault!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_27_01">Take off all the screws, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_23_02">C4 is on the ground. Grab it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_33_01">What? The winch has stopped, get it going again!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_08_07">It is cosy in here. How is it out there, monkey-fuckers?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_34_03">That&apos;s right. Keep going. Almost here, my friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_06_01">Use those roofs to your advantage!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_05_02b">What the hell have I gotten myself into...</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_26_02">That memory stick has gotta be somewhere in the West Wing. </string>
	 <string id="bkl_brn_intro_02b">There&apos;s no chance in hell you&apos;re getting out alive. Firstly, you&apos;re gonna witness me put a bullet through this mechanic&apos;s head, and after that my crew is gonna fuck you up good. </string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_26_any_02">Great - now log me into the system.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_20_02">There&apos;s a load of equipment waiting for you, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_01_03">Let em have it, gang!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_47_03">Give him the key!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_17_03">What was it doing up...?</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_28_01">Bring the hard drive back to the vault and plug it in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_51_01">Now dip that charge in and stand back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_19_02">Gang, the Commissar - that grudging bastard - is dumping a fortune in cocaine just in spite! Get up there and save it. The faster you move, the more you can save!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_regular_a_intro_a_01">It&apos;s bank job time people. Mask up and let&apos;s see what we got.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_31_03">How&apos;s the refueling going?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_42_any_06">Ten left!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_21_01">There are too many fucking boxes here!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_07_07">Keep firing and I can get the door open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_23_01">Time to see what the prison has in store for us.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_22_02">Guys, take cover in the dealership. You don&apos;t want to be near this bang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_54_03">Russian&apos;s got a bit of loot stashed around the place. Not going to make us rich, but every little helps.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_10_03">Looks like a good spot to cut, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_67_01">But that keycard... might be just what we need.</string>
	 <string id="elp_framing_brf_speak_03">Now that senator Borrico has closed his little arms for gold deal, he is ripe for the taking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_11_01">That&apos;s the last stash! You got&apos;em all!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_12_01b">Oh, almost forgot. You&apos;ll need to use a blowtorch to get inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_130_02">Six!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_24_03">Keep spinning those wheels, find the next one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_19_01">Those oil barrels are blocking your path. Find the straps and release them. We don&apos;t have time to find another way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_park_suggest_park_01">There&apos;s a park nearby that should offer some cover...</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_61_01">There&apos;s our prize. Bain will be happy. Take them and go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_19_03">The doors will only open once the ECM jammer stops.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_57_01">Good, now the next hack.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_12_02">Fuel tank is full, well done.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_46_any_10">14 left!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_brf_01_02">Keep an eye out on the alley ways, keep those civilians down and work fast. Let&apos;s get some jewels!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_88_04">Cut our man free so we can get out of here!</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_09_03">Bain - can you make the call?</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_15_any_01">Too slow guys, the getaway left...</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_51_01">It&apos;s on the second floor.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_25_01b">Oooh, stealing some shit, are we? I like it. Anything to make these fucking bikers&apos; lives miserable. Put it in the trunk and I&apos;ll take it with me as I drive off. We&apos;ll deal with the details later!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_84_03">Saw, meet door. Chop chop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_46_01">The drill is done - the gates are opening! Go through and head down the vault corridor. Find the counting room right above the vault and pour out the thermite.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_08_02">Thanks, it&apos;s good to work with professionals.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_14_any_02">Great, so much for the camera alarm.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_06_01">Excellent. Now, take the hostage to the back, away from the cops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_30_02">Bullseye! For once, we&apos;re helped by a pig.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_22_04b">How am I supposed to work like this?!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_15_01">Now get rid of that evidence. There must be a way to destroy it here in the station.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_89_02">Your way out is through the garage! Go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_13_04">Have you found the correct shelf yet, friends? Search a terminal in the tech lab.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_13_03">Pilot is coming in hot, guys. don&apos;t let the cops grab any goats.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_25_01">There&apos;s no easy way out for the tree. We&apos;ll have to take the glass roof off the mall. Signal Bile with a flare and he&apos;ll drop a little present for you. Yeah, C4.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_26_03">Good, that should get rid of the gas. You can most likely enter the room now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_67_04">Another mobster taken care of. Keep at it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_11_02">Tear gas! Heads up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_87_01">As soon as we got two vials in the cooler, you&apos;re ready to bail.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_17_08">Just got a hardware problem. Whoever fixes it gets to meet Alesso.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_48_02">Return to the mainframe and search, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_14_02b">How about that escape? Is your driver coming?</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_26_05">They&apos;re using C4 to take down the walls!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_33_01">Excellent, we got what we came for. Get over to the escape area and secure the EMP.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_36_03">C&apos;mon, you gotta get in there. Use that torch.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_09_10">Do it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_59_03">Control yourselves! You&apos;ll end up chewing through metal until next week!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_13_03">You cleaned the place out. Good job. Time to get the hell out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage2_04_any_01">OK, we&apos;ve got what we need. Time to get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_13_02">You&apos;ll have to help the Captain if you want to get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_64_03">If I know them, and I know them, trust me on that, they&apos;ll have bulldozers up ahead. So get ready for those shits, yeah.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_52_02">The security gate needs to be bypassed so that you can get inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_130_01">Six</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_163_02">You won&apos;t find a better New York steak anywhere, including New York.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_01">...I think.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap07_07">Get the guests out of here. Then have someone come and meet me. We need to secure the house!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_12">...this isn&apos;t what old Locke does best, really.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_03_02">Murky ambush! Kill the chops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_end_b_02">My crew, all master chefs. You got so much product out of that cook we should all break bad and do this full time!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_02_03">You&apos;ll probably find the tunnel if you look around outside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_58_01">I&apos;m going to install some security scramblers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_10_02">Remember, you gotta smash up that meth. </string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_34_01">Achhh! MORE domkops! Courier dropped the winch parts all around. You&apos;ll need to look for them friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_23_01">Found him! He&apos;s in Shaw!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_27_03">I will collect you on the edge of town but get there are quickly and without the cops in tow. Get down to the sewers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_end_a_02b">And it was the right thing not to mess with Hector here - playing with fire would have gotten us burned.</string>
	 <string id="pt2_cs1_01_03">Got it. Making contrails in your direction.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_03_07">Hey Bain, great briefing... I heard jack-shit! Let&apos;s just aah, play it by ear.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_14_03b">We really need that escape car now! How long do you think it will be?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_10_01">Great. Now, blow the doors!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_21_06">Only the best for our boy, Alesso. </string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_10_any_02">Seems to be keys to an airplane.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_14_02">It&apos;s open! Open those deposit boxes!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_84_03">Ach, no way the chopper can land until you shut down those guns. Find the control boxes and disconnect them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_50_01">Now get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_06_01">I&apos;m here! Get him in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_24_01">Move the gold! Let the crane get it on to the truck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_06_any_01">OK, while we wait for the money to burn you can open up some of those deposit boxes. Whatever we find in there is ours.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_36_04">Find the manager. We still need his keycard!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_22_01">Good, now you just have to find a way into his office.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_99_01">Good job! Finding extra loot always makes me happy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_79_01">This goddamn place is a maze. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_45_01">Great job, guys! That server is worth a lot of cash right now. Don&apos;t drop it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_60_03">You got it wrong, now we have to find the master code somehow.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_38_04">How&apos;s it going with finding that uniform?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_21_any_01">Nice work guys! This seems to be the right one! You guys better head out of there ASAP.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_13_03">Get that cocaine before some little kid steals it and I lose money!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_119_02">You never know if Murkys will interrupt the system, so don&apos;t lose focus.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_56b_any_04">... I&apos;m coming back real quick!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_48_02">Bring the key!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_intro_01_02">Shit! These bastards have anti-air defenses set up! Bile, turn the plane around immediately! Guys, use the parachutes and get out! We&apos;ll figure something out!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_07_08">Cover me so I can get the door open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_05_04">You gotta clear the street!</string>
	 <string id="loc_run_04_02">I&apos;ve got a helicopter coming in to pick you up. I believe you are acquainted with the pilot.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_25_01">There you go, one more should do it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_140_02">Great, friends! I&apos;m on my way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_intro_01_02">We&apos;re here. Get inside and get your hands on the access codes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_07_02">You see the button there? All you need to do is press it. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_41_03">Perfect. Now let the nitrogen fill the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_127_03">Im done, on to the next hack.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_85_01">Three</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_24_02">I&apos;ll get to work. Cover me!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_38_01">OK, that&apos;s it. Get to the vault and open it with the keycard and code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_41_any_01">Well, no giant piles of money, search through the deposit boxes for valuables.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_52_01">Yeah! Got our seven bucks back. Suck it, parking meter!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_19">I can&apos;t believe this shit!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_01_02">Time to show me some more of your stealthy skills. The rest of you wait by the van and keep a lookout if things would turn south.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_37_04">There could be something behind the books, like in one of those old spy movies, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_03_01">You ready for this guys? The greatest damn heist of all!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_32_any_01">Guys, it&apos;s fewer bags than we expected, but we can still do the trade and hope they agree to give us the information.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_28_01">That&apos;s it, guys, but we still need to plant more C4 on the fifth floor and the roof.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_81_08">Everything you&apos;ve taken needs to go out on the zip.</string>
	 <string id="plt_chw_intro_02">This feels like something out from a cowboy movie and Bile likes it, gentlemen! Anyhow, here&apos;s where I drop you off. I&apos;ll be on standby until you give me the signal to come back and pick up the loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_end_a_01">And now Mendoza and his goons are down a lot of firepower. Hector&apos;s people will face a lot less resistance thanks to you. He might even appreciate us. Well done. </string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_10_any_04">Bags! I need bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_18_02">Good job! You proved you still got what it takes, Dallas.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_111_01">Bile is waiting for you guys! He&apos;s got the winch. Come on, light the flare!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_29_03">Good job. Now go to the fifth floor and finish the job.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_99_02">Go on, bring the car key!</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_10_01">The bastard bought it. Get in there and kill him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_18_any_04">It is all going to hell - get the intel!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_27_03">Just what we needed! Plug that hard drive in and I&apos;ll take care of it. That vault should be opened in no time.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_04_03">Hurry and open the gate!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_41_any_01">Looks like we&apos;re out of luck. This one&apos;s no good. Go get me another. I&apos;m sending the chopper back to pick it up.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_02_02">I will go back to boat and contact you with instructions.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_160_02">Uh, this is, Francoise. I am calling from the Customer Satisfaction desk.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_45_03">The bomb is now just sitting there. Restart it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_02_02">According to Rust, the OVERKILL MC have the tech in one of the cars in the front. Get over there as fast as you can and don&apos;t stop. We don&apos;t have much time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_18_02">Alright, he should be safe now. Place a flare on the table outside the yard. Set it off to bring in the chopper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_39_01">Put the thermal lance to good use and get the panic room open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_50_03">Those gates are rigged to stay locked if someone&apos;s on them. So get off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_62_02">Change of plan! You have to use ziplines instead to secure the bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_end_01_01">Real professional gentlemen! They don&apos;t even know what hit them!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_35_02">Have you found the office yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_96_02">Make sure you get the right key now!</string>
	 <string id="btm_cs1_01_04">Roberts Bank is happy to help you, sir.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_49_03">There should be a circuit box nearby.</string>
	 <string id="csm_cs1_01_03">Yeah, there&apos;s a charge on my credit card the wife can&apos;t see. I was in Mexico and...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_30_02">Sure the Captain heard that, so we can rule out him cooperating. No time to turn the screw on him either, so we bypass him. Hack the ship control terminal. Keep it running.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_162_02">I wanted to remind you that our All You Can Eat buffet is now open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_27_01">Okay, the scientists working here are using some next level shit. You&apos;re gonna need the lead scientist for handprint authorization. See where he&apos;s hiding.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_79_04">Come on, come on... Piece of Russian crap...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_28_02">Nearly got it. Come on, come on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_58_01">A luta continua!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_66_01">Of course you can customize masks like you can customize weapons.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_intro_01_02">Okay gamblers. Let&apos;s get gambling.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_30_01">Open sesame! Now find our wayward friend!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_09_01">You need to find that saw, friends.</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_13_any_01">OK, throw me the paintings, and you&apos;ll get your money!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_brief_01c">Don&apos;t get the heat on you too early or your escape is going to be rough. Check your assets. Let&apos;s go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_58_03">This is the room! Now put that drill to work!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_29_01">Ok guys. I&apos;m opening container 57 remotely. Get ready to run.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_05_05">Feeling good? If your piss glows in the dark, consult a doctor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_20">...I&apos;m 93% sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_10_08">Hydrogen chloride has to be right.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_106_01">We gotta open this dock gate to get the Moretta to Dock 3B.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_83_05">Don&apos;t forget to check the interrogation rooms.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_04a_any_01">I&apos;m there in three minutes...</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_69_03">I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s in another part of the building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_51_02">Get the C4 in there, and get ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_27_01">Okay gang. Time to put on a show.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_01">Sorry.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_79_01">Why isn&apos;t that gate open yet? Check all the rooms!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_19_02">How much for parking? That&apos;s a robbery! </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_59_01">Wait for it... </string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_62_02">Damn, BFD is bust. You need tools to fix her up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_22_any_01">Look for bookshelves, see if you can move them and find something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_ent_02_01">Now the police have to enter from the front door! </string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_end_b_01">We lost a little coke on this job but it could&apos;ve been worse. Hector will still be pleased with us saving what we could.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_07_03">Nice. With the camera out of the way, you can safely lock pick that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_71_02">Great. Here comes the guest list now.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_08_05">Haha, the Commissar outsmarts you again, assholes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_77_01">Alright. The cage is put together. But it&apos;s empty. Get it filled!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_18_02">Blast blew wagons everywhere. Might be loot in some of &apos;em. And check &apos;em for any C4. You&apos;ll need it soon.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_intro_01a">Left a bit.. there we go... ACH, bekakin&apos; civvie! Whoa, almost got that one too. A little faster.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_14_01">My access got cut off. Check it out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_02_01">That&apos;s it. We got the turret. Now all we need is some ammo.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_05_02">This will be a lesson to all: Don&apos;t fuck with The Butcher. Thank you for your help, my friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_53_03">That&apos;s it, yeah? Can&apos;t see what&apos;s so special, but it&apos;s why we&apos;re here. Same writing that Lindenhurst found.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_55_02">Damn cops are at the door. Get ready for them!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_78_03">Looks like it&apos;s working. Will take some time before it&apos;s full.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_02_any_01">Get into the house.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_36_02">We stole this from a lab not a million miles from here. Two hundred thirty eight thousand six hundred and six miles, to be precise.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_31_02">Great. Sure we can find a use for a little C4 later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_30_02">Great, now we can open the crates laying around much faster. I bet you they contain some good stuff.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_32_02">That scanner will need an authority, like a FBI boss. Watch for him and for God&apos;s sake don&apos;t kill him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_24_03">Ah, the door opens! Now, let us proceed into the inner complex with speed and violence.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_92_01">Good job, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_97_04">Come on friends... GO!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_44_02">Hey, there he is. Looks like he&apos;s around the stairs.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_13_03">Alright! The helicopter should be coming in soon!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_75_01">Look for a door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_164_01">We&apos;re serving... uh... soup. Made with... uh... vegetables.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_05_07">Fuck yeah. We ain&apos;t done yet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_12_02">Guys, move! Charon will meet you in the other building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_40_02">Hold the ground. Bile will have that winch to you any second.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_76_05">Stop anyone from getting to the cannon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_41_02">Focus on the next part. Get him out, get the server in the trunk and get to the transfer room on room on floor three.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_12_01">Good spot. Now we wait.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_23_03">Heard a story about this guy once... hid something in a light fixture, then electrocuted himself to death by not being careful when he went to get it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_64_03">Don&apos;t waste any time, just keep him moving.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_15_any_01">They are coming up on the balcony!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_87_03">Blerrie! The drill is no longer turning. Start it up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_61_01">Slap some C4 on that wall, crew!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_26_04">They&apos;re breaching in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_25_03">Where the hell is that pilot?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_24_02">You need to restart the power, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_92_04">The door, friends! Get it open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_15_02">There&apos;s a zipline you can use to secure the bags of loot.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_33_01">It&apos;s a beautiful painting. Last seen on the walls of a well known South American dictator. See how the artist captured the light and all that shit? Beautiful.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_34_02">The pump stopped again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_12_02">Have you found a way to get the gate open?</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_06_03">Ok, search for Tin Boy toys in the toy store.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_07_01">That&apos;s him. Locke.</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_06_01">Hey, someone needs help. Get over there.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_cnc_02">The Sosa Cartel has attacked one of my shipments in the Caribbean. They must pay, and you will collect this payment.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_12_01">The panic room is somewhere inside the mansion; keep looking. It should be a reinforced door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_07_01">Gang. Shut down the power to the metal detectors. Crack open the circuit boxes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_63_03">Thought that tunnel would never end! No time to waste, friends. Everyone knows you&apos;re there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_01a">Guess this will be a bit of fun, yeah? Messing about with the Commissioner...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_24_01">Get the power back up friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_10_01">What are you waiting for? Go to the computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_02_01">The testimonies are somewhere in the Archives. Search through their records and see if you can&apos;t find them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_02_01">Up! Up! Up, up, up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_01_03">We&apos;re here. Get ready to scare &apos;em, crew.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_42_02">Can&apos;t be much longer for the tanks to run out of liquid, so Bile will be there shortly with a delivery.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_15_any_01">They&apos;ve mined the place! Watch your step!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_63_01">The saw is through, so get in there and check the patient.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_22_01">Hose looks secure. Start the pump.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_22_02">You know what to do when you&apos;re ready. Send that balloon up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_02_any_01">You&apos;re looking for four bags of jewels minimum from this place. Easy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_23">...I&apos;m 84% sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_58_02">The detonator has been stopped!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_03_02">The server room. Get me hooked up, guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_04_03">...Find the wall-boxes that control the blast doors, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_14_03">It stopped on the question marks again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_34_any_01">Guys... Can you see any hints on what the correct one should look like?</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_end_a_02">Good work, team. With micro cameras installed in the paintings, we just need to trade them to the senator&apos;s people. I&apos;ll set up the meet right now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_06_02">Get over there and help the crew.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_55_03">The detonator needs to be rigged.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_07_02">You can probably hack through one of the doors on this floor with a saw, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_11_01">The snipers have me pinned down. I can&apos;t move until you clear them out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_03d_02">Nice work! The third wave was beaten back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_28_01">I&apos;m grabbing the pyro schedule. I&apos;ll guide you guys through, and time it with the C4.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_67_02">You guys are seriously in the wrong place if you&apos;re looking for extra loot. Get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_14_03">Now go get the keycard.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_intro_01_01b">Fuckin&apos; nice one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_18_03">Damn, they stopped it. Get it going again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_intro_03a">Hmm, hope the weather doesn&apos;t bother our equipment. Wouldn&apos;t be good it you guys got cut off in there, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_73_03">Why aren&apos;t you in the wine cellar? And when you get there, best not drink any.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_06">Fuck me sideways!</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_06_02">I swear I was being followed for a while, and not by cops either.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_10_01">Whoa, that&apos;s a nice little coke stash they got there. It&apos;s up for grabs if you ask me.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_03_03">Kêrels are just outside! Be ready for anything, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_61_02">That&apos;s what we&apos;re looking for! Gotta admit I&apos;m a bit underwhelmed by how they look, but grab them, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_07_any_02">Codes. Bring them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_105_02">A three digit code will open the armory. Find it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_89_03">You need to get the drill going.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_04a_any_04">I&apos;m coming in, in three minutes...</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_56_02">The end is upon us. And it is a good ending! Please, into the helicopter!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_19_02">Remember to strike a flare to summon the evac.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_06_03">Still gotta find the whiteboard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_02_01">He&apos;s getting away!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_93_02">There&apos;s still gas in the vault. </string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_intro_a_02">Looks like they expect a fight. I know you will give em one. Find the safe and the address... get as much intel from these scumbags as you can. Let&apos;s roll.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_43_02">That&apos;s the right choice, guys. Keep scanning away. We didn&apos;t come all the way to Russia for a small payout, now did we?</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_08_02">Diesel is now filling in ship.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_15_02">Chopper&apos;s is in-bound for the crash site. Stand by, gang!</string>
	 <string id="loc_wwh_intro_02">Don&apos;t know how to say this really, but there&apos;s been a change of plan. Gotta leave you now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_gold_a_intro_a_02">OK this is your standard job only it&apos;s gold-plated, if you take my meaning. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_12_02">Keep searching. The control room has to be here.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_08_03b">Fuck me, man... I don&apos;t wanna die over this shit... I&apos;ll keep my promise and assemble the bike for ya, but I&apos;m staying right here. Find the parts and bring them back here.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_24_03b">Fuck me back and forth: We are done! Take this bike and get the hell outta here. I&apos;m not staying a moment longer!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_12_any_02">Have you found the power yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_15_03">Drills done! Vault&apos;s opening! Go for the cash!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_60_03">Blueprints to a vault. Interesting.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_19_02">Our guy likes Red Dragon scotch. Find it, spike it and serve it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_intro_01_03">It&apos;s a dirty job, but easy money.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_79_02">C&apos;mon, get in the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_52_any_01">Get that gold up to the roof, put it in the bag on the zip line, we are bringing it home!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_12_02">Guys, three bags, that&apos;s what we need.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_21">They&apos;re not letting us go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_07_any_01">That looks useful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_20_02">One of the civilians is trying to escape, keep em&apos; in check guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_62_05">Get going to the weapons lab.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_16_02">Got it. You can open the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_63_03">If they&apos;re going by the book they&apos;ll have snipers set up ahead. These cocks always go by the book.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_60_03">Even if we blow up the radar, they can still control this from the laptop. We need to hack it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_51_02">Our guy is waiting to shut down the gig. Just answer that intercom when you&apos;re ready. Make sure all the loot you wanna take is secured.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_109_08">Job is over guys. Time to go.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_01_03">And bring me back some chimichangas or something!</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_20_01">Hey Asswipe! The Intercom!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_04_02">Are you lost? Jump out of window. Way out is straight down.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_08a_any_04">I&apos;m in place!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_10_03">The roof is not an option, We&apos;re going to have to &quot;improvise&quot;... slightly.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_46_03">Hook up the chain from the truck to the gate!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_09_03">One of Buluc&apos;s old girlfriends &quot;volunteered&quot; information after we threw some cash her way,  that you can find the way to open this door in a part of the house that Buluc calls the &quot;inner sanctum&quot;. Go find the entrance to it, chop chop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_overpass_more_snipers_01">Police chatter has confirmed the presence of snipers. Keep your eyes on those rooftops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_26_01">Now look for a vent, and get the gas pumping. Send the security to Neverland.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_60_01">Fantastic! Now don&apos;t scratch it! </string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_05_01">These guys aren&apos;t kidding around. Don&apos;t act dumb and go in the room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_20_02">That&apos;s the first keycard. Second one&apos;s gotta be here somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_50_03">Now, please, bring the loot bags to the helicopter.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_53_01">Twitch is waiting for you on the other side of that door! Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_13_03">You need to deal with those fires. Use the sprinklers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_19_04">Turn the power on, then restart the terminal override.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_36_03">Protect the X-ray device! Don&apos;t let the mercenaries get to it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_113_03">Use the ladder guys, climb the hell out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_46_01">Now climb down and get the bags to the van. Watch your step.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_07_01">What? You want me to dress up like a cop??</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_47_02">There goes the wall. A garbage truck is your drop-off. Get hauling.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_05_any_03">Alright, they just need to call you back. Faster the better.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_36_03">Good job, now get the hell away from there before it goes off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_09_01">Wait.. what... they&apos;ve got additional security blocks. You gotta disable them. Find a security switchboard and rewire the system.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_05_01">Rust really wants a chrome skull for his bike, and we have no time to argue. Use the blowtorch the mechanic gave you when you reach the clubhouse.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_end_b_02">It&apos;s OK if things go loud, so long as you did the job right. I&apos;m searching the data now. Half a database is a bit of a lottery - let&apos;s hope we get lucky.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_09_03">We&apos;re taking some of these nice weapons with us. But how, that&apos;s the question...</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_09_01">Guys, get the truck down! Shoot away those wires.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_45_03">That&apos;s the head of security. Hmm... he&apos;s by the driveway I think.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_bag_02_01">The ammo bag can be found in the storage room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_13_03">Waiting on that network access gang.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_22_03b">Wow, hey! How am I supposed to do my thing like this? Take care of &apos;em!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_06_01">What the holy fuck! You dare! I&apos;ll fucking kill you! Kill you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_04_02">They took Eddie out! You&apos;re still on foot, guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_14_03">If you get the chance, maybe grab some loot that might be useful to sell. It&apos;s not every day you got free reign in the the FBI&apos;s evidence lockup!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_11_any_03">One down. One to go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_41_05">Just follow our friendly kerel. And don&apos;t let the real ones see you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_147_01">This is the Security Center.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_20_03">I&apos;m jealous you&apos;re going to get to drive this beast.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_10_02">That&apos;s the last fan. Man, look at that temperature climb. I got a bad feeling about this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_19_01">Get the stuff from the safe!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_07_01">Grab the C4, gang! </string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_11_01">Well, there goes plan A. Glad the crowd didn&apos;t hear any of that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_23_any_01">You need to add the hydrogen chloride to keep the process going!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_23_01">With all the ruckus going on, I reckon the White House aids will have gotten sloppy. Maybe have a look in their computers to see if you can find something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_13_03">That&apos;s the helicopter. Get on it, crew!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_07_02">I can&apos;t open the door while they are firing at me!</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_10_01">Wait here. I&apos;ll be right back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_97_01">Great, That&apos;s the pit boss&apos; number.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_60_01">He&apos;s back again? Alright, let&apos;s try one more thing. Feds can&apos;t resist food. See if anyone is having a late snack and put some by his office.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_22_02">Kerels are trying to take back the hostage.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_brf_01_01">Well, lads, thanks for breakin&apos; me out. But I shouldn&apos;t have been there to begin with. Someone set me up. I&apos;m sure of it. The Feds had too much on me. Way more than those mingebag wankers could dig up. Someone ratted. Someone fucked me. And I&apos;m gonna find out who.$NL;$NL;Now, it ain&apos;t gonna be easy. No fannying about around the edges, right? No shadowy deals or contacts, or that bollocks. We&apos;re going to the source. The biggest FBI nest. Gonna find out who screwed me.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_03_07">There&apos;s a half-eaten candy bar here. Mmmmm nutty. Oh....wasn&apos;t a candy bar.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_27_any_02">Hang tight, I&apos;m looking for another escape point.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_04_02">Smack that asshole so he wakes up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_15_any_08">Vault&apos;s cracked, let&apos;s see what we got!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_44_01">Touch down! Now load the plane with loot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_57_03">We need a change of plan, the code has been shut down!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_06_any_04">That&apos;s all I have room for.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_57_02">Sorry about this friends, but I&apos;ve got to pull you out via the sewers. Get to them outside... and you&apos;ll need some thermite to burn through the grating.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_04_02">Use the blowtorch to create a way through that car.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_18_any_02">Stop throwing the coke into the fucking water!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_09_01">That&apos;s the second stash. Two to go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_20_any_04">It&apos;s go-time!</string>
	 <string id="vld_nightclub_brf_speak_03b">Get the money and get out! Let them know Vlad started the party!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_66_03">You need to find a flammable liquid!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_35_03">Bile is in-bound. Be ready for him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_03_03">Vault&apos;s not here. OK, keep searching.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_83_any_01">Guys, the thermal drill. Go get it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_44_01a">I&apos;m almost afraid to ask...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_18_02">Looks like his drink is getting low. Lets serve him another, with a little something added. Find the same bottle at one of the bars.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_89_03">Make your way out through the garage!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_10_any_02">30 thousand guys, keep it up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_113_01">Don&apos;t loose that keycard, you&apos;re gonna need it later.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_60_01">You&apos;ll need to restart the drill!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_54_02">That&apos;s the pump done. Great work!.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_03_02">Locke, if you promise to not fucking crash this helicopter, I&apos;ll get you a new set of golf clubs, right?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_13_01">Find the Commissioner&apos;s office, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_intro_01_01">OK, gang. We&apos;re here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_07">That&apos;s what you get for trusting the internet, I guess.</string>
	 <string id="elp_bigoil_brf_intro_01">Politics is as you know global - I need you for a global effort.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_14_02">There, that&apos;s it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_02_02">Bloody dwankies found you already! Mr. Blonde, take that Porky in the back and the gang will take care of the other kêrels.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_11_02">Great - that&apos;s the last of &apos;em!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_112_03">Blerrie chop Murky soldiers... hope they don&apos;t follow.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_62_01">You gotta get into that tunnel, friends. </string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_06d_02">Nice work! The sixth wave was beaten back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_end_b_01">Well, we didn&apos;t get the gold, but we&apos;ll still be compensated for the successful frame job we pulled. Well done, people.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_82_03">Don&apos;t forget to turn the power back on. Blind here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_83_02">Look for a code that starts with two.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_24_02">Cops are on the way. Time is important, so hustle!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_11_01">No luck! No DNA match found on the evidence. Keep looking and scanning!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_40_01">Thirty seconds, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_brf_01_01">I&apos;m not gonna lie; we are taking a huge risk by double-crossing Akan, but I believe this is the right choice. First thing is getting the EMP bomb that is being transported by Murkywater. They will be making a scheduled stop. That will be our chance. Get in quietly, find the EMP, then get out of there. You need to do this by stealth, so dress the part.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_37_02">That&apos;s great. But if you want to grab some more, do so!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_110_01">The van&apos;s got to bug out, but the driver dropped a thermal drill. That&apos;s the only way into the vault now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_95_02">Loot for the taking...</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_35_03">Right! And...left!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_03_03">Get that sniper!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_10_03b">An engine. That&apos;s what we need. I think I saw some inside the clubhouse before they started beating the livin&apos; shit out of me.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_44_02">...Could maybe open them up with a computer, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_38_01">Aha! Ship database, including comm frequencies. Great! That&apos;s what we need. Now get on the horn to the Captain.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_03_01">That electric box controls the gate. Sure you could have it open in seconds.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_05_02">Damn, that&apos;s the alarm. Get ready for action!</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_08_01">Good! Get the rest and we will get them out of here. I hope this fucking train is a smooth ride.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_24_02">There&apos;s more gear outside if you need it, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_37_03">That zip-line is your way out - get there!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_23_any_01">I&apos;m already waiting for you at dock nine!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_11_01">Plant C4 on the truck doors, gang.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_56a_any_01">I got to keep moving!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_38_02">Ship database. Should have... Got it! Comm frequency for the Moretta. This is it! Now find a radio. Let&apos;s call the Captain.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_08_01">That&apos;s the one, bring it back to the mechanic!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_02_02">The testimonies Hox needs are down here somewhere. Search the records.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_111_01">General admin office. A terminal here might hold the Moretta&apos;s comm frequency. Good chance of a keycard or radio too.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_15_03">Right, they didn&apos;t leave the key in the car. Smart cops.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_22">What the fuck did you guys steal!?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_86_02">Gang, I can&apos;t stress how important electricity is to computers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_43_02">Saw through that roof and drag him out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_41_03">That&apos;s the head of security. Down by the water, at the dock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_117_03">Come on, Dentists&apos; loot is right there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_32_02">Watch it! Don&apos;t let the cops take the balloon down!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_89_03">Ready to go? Light a flare!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_06_01">There&apos;s the hose! Connect it to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_03_any_02">The boat driver needs to know when he should come in. Look around in the warehouse for the floodlight switch.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_20_01">Bain is making short work of the Murkys. To get through here, you&apos;ll have to drill the door and get the dead guard&apos;s keychain.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_54_02">An inside contact has rigged up spy cameras and surveillance drones. You can access them from the gadget on the roof.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_52_03">Ok, have a breather and I&apos;ll do rest, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_15_any_01">Great! That is all of them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_38_01">Don&apos;t forget. Look for the ladder, dear friends.</string>
	 <string id="rb22_bph_intro_01a">Whose idea was it to go in from here?</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_19_02">Not much more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_52_03">Excellent job! We know where he is. Now hustle back to the car. Grab any loot before the Fed&apos;s get it. You know... Those crates gave me an idea...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_55_02">Blerrie! Didn&apos;t work. You must&apos;ve mixed it wrong. Wait a bit and try again, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_01_02a">This is your chance to plan your course of action.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_12_any_06">Mmmhmm, fine fine.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_18_any_01">Good.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_42_01">Focus on the next part. Get him out, get the server in the trunk and get to the transfer room on the ground floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_03_03">Engage the cops! Make them forget about the truck!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_07_03">The wheel stopped on flames, I don&apos;t think that is a good thing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_19_02">Guys! There&apos;s another closet door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_69_01">Ok guys, the ASIM is pass. Our tracks are now gone.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_28_03">All right, got the show&apos;s schedule. We can do this.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_83_01">Take the boxes from the conveyor, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_36_01">The boat&apos;s waiting for you at the lake. You can zip-line aboard.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_47_02">Not good. There&apos;s a system lock in place. You&apos;ll have to get to the mainframe computer and hack it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_08_06">It&apos;s muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_31_01">What are you waiting for? The vault is open.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_25_03b">Throw it into the truck, we&apos;ll deal with it later!</string>
	 <string id="plt_flt_10_01">OK, lowering the winch.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_01_any_02">Boat here. I see the signal, I&apos;m coming in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_08_01">The wheel stopped on flames. Things are about to burn!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_35_03">Ship&apos;s there. Get on it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_11_02">I&apos;m sending the van, keep bagging the stuff!</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cs1_04_01">Starting my approach. ETA four minutes. Over.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_57_03">You&apos;re not going to just stroll out the front. Get upstairs, and blast through into the office next door. That&apos;s the way out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_03_06">Had a look at the barriers yet?</string>
	 <string id="ism_al1_01_02">Get into the closet when you&apos;re ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_12_01">Now keep the heat off it. Let it do its job.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_69_01">Still searching for the USB? Check back in IT.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_intro_01">Oh shit!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_89_05">Bile is waiting for the signal, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_04_any_03">Server room now! Hurry before we get all of the FBI on our asses!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_45_03">A job well done! Now, get the hell out of there fast. That building won&apos;t keep standing for long.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_17_04">Don&apos;t&apos; forget the door, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_36_01">Get to the archaeology room.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_18_any_02">That&apos;s six!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_41_01">You gotta find some clues. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt2_03_01">Wait, you didn&apos;t get ALL of the goats. Is my asshole your plaything? I want ALL the goats. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_35_03">A TV crew. Hmm... try to stay off their camera.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_08a_any_02">OK, I&apos;m in position!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_02_03">That truck needs to be safe. Draw fire away from it. </string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_37_02">Find a way to get in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_70_02">Nice! Now, hurry over to the vault. Chop chop!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_06_02">The wheel stopped on sniper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_intro_01_03">You wanna play a game? A meth-cooking game?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_52_04">Very good! The bird is out of the cage!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_85_02">Keep the heat away from the circuit breakers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_cafe_arrival_subway_01">OK, the gate is open, get to that subway entrance.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_89_01">Now get down to the garage - it&apos;s the way out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_49_01">If none of you have picked up the extra can of thermite hidden inside the copy machine, you should go get and get it and pour it out. More thermite means faster melting process.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_20_01b">Hey hey hey guys, Guys! you better tell my brother-in-law to step on it!</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_11_07">How the fuck did they know we were gonna be here!?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_57_02">Gimme a couple of minutes to confirm the barcode. Hold on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_53_02">The hack has been interrupted!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_08">They&apos;re flushing that coke away. Gang, get up there before it&apos;s all gone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_103_02">Watch for cameras. Don&apos;t let them see you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_01_01">Remember we need both the Taxman and the server, people. Scare him and make him go into the limo once we&apos;ve confirmed that he has the server on him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_52_01">Blerrie! It wants to run an automatic firmware update. Hurry and stop it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_15_any_02">Good work! Get back to the cooking. Use the time between waves to find more ingredients.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_164_02">Also... that Italian stuff... uh... spaghetti! You can have as many tins as you want.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_03_01">Draw fire from the truck, gang. </string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_03_03b">Eh, I&apos;ll say it for you: you didn&apos;t come here only to save me, now did ya? No, you&apos;re here for the custom built bike, am I right or am I right? I&apos;ll help you. I owe you that much, but you&apos;ll have to get me the parts I need.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_cbf_01_02">This is Roberts bank. It&apos;s a small DC company, almost as old as the city itself. And while I have a lot of respect for the fine institutions of this nation, I have greater respect for what they hold in their vault. My intel says this branch has the lowest hit-rate in the country. Time to change that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_07_02">While I&apos;m hacking the system, you should go ahead and find those code parts. Remember, one per laptop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_110_02">Your driver had to bail. He left behind a drill. Get it, and use it on the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_58_03">Disable the alarm! It&apos;s counting down and things are gonna get real messy once it reaches 0.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_80_01">We gotta get the ship moving! Lemme think... Alright, just hack the ship control terminal and make sure it stays on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_18_01">You might wanna scout the wagons for some extra loot. And keep your eyes open for C4. You&apos;re gonna need it later. Should be in one of the crates.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_04_any_01">Alright, I&apos;ve got your pick-up driver on the line, patching him through now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_95_01">That&apos;s a lot of stones.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_12_01">The pilot just fell down. Damn, is he sleeping? You need to wake him up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_03_04">Don&apos;t forget to take a look at the security checkpoint, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_26_02">Cool, break through the gates. You need a crowbar!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_49_03">Why would Murky have the artifact in a bio-lab? No matter, go and find it, yeah? And hope you don&apos;t need hazmat suits.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_43_03">No need to sneak about any longer!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_18_01">Damn it, they stopped the charge!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_06_04">Alright, there&apos;s the door and there&apos;s the first lock. Get the codebreakers working.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_11_any_01">OK, be careful! It will be worth sneaking all the way through, boys. No alarms and this framing will be perfect!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_07_02">So that&apos;s Locke.</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_03_02">Look for the guys packing the coke. Make sure these &quot;elves&quot; know they&apos;re making toys for Santa fucking Christmas! Me! Okay?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_31_02">Now drive!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_08_02">Shouldn&apos;t be too much longer.</string>

	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_end_b_04">More guns, more money. Great work. Hector is waiting for us.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_03_06">Are the goats safe? Please, God, someone think of the goats!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_157_02">I think they saw that from the ISS!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_78_02">We have to blow that gate. Get the C4 on it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_11_any_01">That&apos;s probably blueprints of the building.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_29_02">Use the thermite I sent to weaken that vault door, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_01_02">That could have gone a lot worse. Now untie him and let&apos;s get going.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_04_01">There&apos;s sleeping gas too. Grab it. You&apos;ll need it later.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_51_01">You gotta get through that door. I think the artifact is on the other side. What about cooking up a fun cocktail to burn through it? Maybe there&apos;s a recipe for something suitably volatile around there? Heh... what could go wrong, eh?</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_08_02">Keep your wits about you, Zeal Marksmen are on the way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_27_03">You&apos;ll need to break into the elevator shaft! See if you can find a crowbar!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_71_01">OK, you shouldn&apos;t have to wait too much longer for Bile.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_07_01">C&apos;mon friends, no standing around.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_38_01">You gotta get that dinges out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_12_03">Throw the bags over the side. You can fish them out of the water when you get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_19_02">Don&apos;t go to the neighbours.</string>

	 <string id="brs_pt1_05_01">I&apos;m here! Bring the goats!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_41_02">Good job, that drone won&apos;t be here to witness the robot revolution. But make sure you hide the pile of junk. We can&apos;t have one of the guards finding it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_29_03">You put in the wrong code, they&apos;re onto you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_26_03">Get to the escape point, clowns! Follow the blue containers!</string>

	 <string id="btc_fri_10_02">You tricked him. Excellent. Now kill him.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_04_02">Kill the guards. Then you can kill Ernesto Sosa.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_61_02">That&apos;s it. Well done! The vault is opening again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_57_03">Keep looking for the evidence room!</string>

	 <string id="pln_drk_04_03">The Murkywater trains will have a security panel on the side, so we&apos;ll have to hack them open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_end_a_02">I guess they cared more about their fix than information. Junkies aren&apos;t great with abstraction. Meanwhile the Mendozas are leaving for the airport in a rented bus, escorted by undercover FBI. </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_31_01">Alright. Now apply the drill to that safe and drag the garden hose down into the shelter.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_47_02">Now you just need to start moving loot to Mr Blonde&apos;s car.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_04_02">That&apos;s the stuff. Keep going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_can_02_01">Don&apos;t forget to find the elves. Shout at them to make them work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_29_02">Paydirt! That&apos;s what we came for, gang.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_02_04">You gotta find a way in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_gold_a_intro_a_04">Crew this is hot off the wire. I have a gold deposit waiting for us. </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_105_01">The federales are using shape charges to open up another wall!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_27_03">We got it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_81_01">Get to the ship control terminal and hack it!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_50_any_14">18 more needed!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_62_04">What the hell! That crazy chopper is back.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_06_02">Hose needs to connect to ship.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_56_01">What are you waiting for, friends?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_109_01">You&apos;re not getting out of there unless you use a drill!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_63_03">How convenient, he won&apos;t run away now. Cut off his hand and bring it to the scanner.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_14_02">What about taking the manager&apos;s fingerprints off something with a piece of tape, so we can bypass the scanner quietly?</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_01x_01">There in....</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_13_02">Look around the office, find who our IT guy is. Then hack his pc.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_65_03">This will be over fast if you don&apos;t get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_56_02">Hello? Yes Sir, no problems at all. We&apos;re just running some tests.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_92_03">Second digit for the code. Now, just get the last number and we&apos;re set.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_52_01">You gotta get that floor open, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_52_05">I&apos;m pretty sure there&apos;s something suitable around there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_144_01">This game room is the heart of The Golden Grin.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_57_02">I don&apos;t want to keep someone who calls herself the Butcher waiting. Get onto the ship!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_53_03">For every bag of evidence you secure, I will provide compensation. Crime.net needs to be protected.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_02_01">You&apos;re in. Now, the target is the voting machines. They&apos;re likely in shipping crates, so look around for those.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_14_04">Student loan  erased! But no codes. Try another.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_26">...I&apos;m 68% sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_15_any_02">Bag it up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_23_01">Good. Now keep the cops off of it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_72_02">Vlad, you chop! You said the vault was going to be easy!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_21_03">OK, that&apos;s it. When you&apos;ve got the loot aboard, you need to juice it up as well.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_21_01">These assholes chained me up! Get this shit off me!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_50_01">All right, the thermite should be halfway done by now. Keep keepin&apos; on, gentlemen.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_end_a_02">I know that was a lot of money to send up in smoke and I apologize, I know it goes against your nature, but hopefully you find the compensation competitive.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_15_any_01">If you guys wanna keep going, Vlad&apos;s giving us a bonus for everything over 50k!</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_10_03">The cops got to the Saw. Restart it ASAP.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_10_01">Shit, the alarm! You need to find the security room. We can&apos;t do anything while this place is in lockdown!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_75_04">Go find that armory!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_105_02">You gotta restart the override on that box.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_70_02">The guest list, guys. Get it from reception and we can see who&apos;s in our room.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_05_03">You look like rats in a maze. No cheese at the end for you though. Only assfuck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_18_02">Gang, find gas and ignite the tires. Give that chopper a nice thick smokescreen to worry about!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_02_04">So, next step is...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_10_02">Into the docks, gang, c&apos;mon.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_59_03">I know an IT dwankie when I see one, even in Mexico. Take that man to the server room and make him open up the security bars.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_03_02">Gang, find that vault. It&apos;ll be in a shipping container. Probably those Murkywater ones.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_78_02">Just gotta give it some time to fill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_17_any_01">There are snipers on the surrounding buildings.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_13_01">I think the cops are calling the house, they&apos;re probably on to us.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_51_02">Ok, let&apos;s get him out with an &apos;urgent&apos; email. You&apos;ve got another compromised computer near you we can use.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_53_01">Start the winch and it will move BFD into position. Don&apos;t let the cops stop it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_intro_06_02">Gensec on approach. Let&apos;s get this jam started. OK, hit it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_120_01">Good afternoon. Roberts bank. How can I help you?</string>
	 <string id="cpn_cr2_02_01">Port of Washington radio. This is Moretta. Standing by to receive GPS data. Over.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_21_01">How are those drills coming?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_21_01">Find the pink schnapps bottle and spike it.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_16">I&apos;m losing control!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_58_01">Here we are! You&apos;ll have to drill it open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_20_03">Alright friends, just give me some time to connect.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_15_02">There&apos;s the vault! Great! Now use the thermite on the top and burn your way through. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_51_03">Mr Blonde can&apos;t escape unless you lead the cops away!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_22_01">Grab the keychain friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_intro_01b">Look at this, I&apos;m rich!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_69_06">Protect the routers.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_26_01">I love opening Christmas presents!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_04_01">Look out for ways to get in. Has to be some weak point in the security. Get a close look at that fence.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_16_any_02">Alright, four!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_137_02">The Golden Grin never closes. You want to waste time nickel-and-diming the slots...?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_13_01">Thats one batch done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_77_03">Need to hurry gang.</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_15_any_01">Thanks, here&apos;s the cash!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_22_02">That door is too tough for the drill. But I&apos;m sure the armory will have something that can take it out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_59_03">You knocked him out? Really?</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_29_01">Right, you need to use some of the thermite I sent on those vault hinges, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_95_04">Remember, you need those car keys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_03_03">If you don&apos;t find the Murkywater trains, we&apos;re not getting the EMP bomb.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_27_01">Good, now plug it into one of the laptops.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_16_04">Hurry friends, you need to get into that computer.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_41_01">Now grab as much of Vlad&apos;s merchandise as you can, but stay quiet!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_07_any_10">Keep that news feed alive and I&apos;ll start getting you a way out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_brief_01b">Preferably take them as the money will be great that way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_67_01">It&apos;s simplicity itself, friends. Just press the button of the vault you want to open. Just be sure it actually contains something.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_95_02">Get Vlad&apos;s merchandise!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_03_02">That&apos;s what we are after. Get it to the van.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_03_03">GPS is online. Providing you tagged the right truck, this is great work. Time to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_intro_01_02">We&apos;re at the night club. Time to get your dance-on. Start by &quot;casing&quot; the place before the fun begins. Take a look around first and keep things casual.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_14_03">Gas! Shit, get out of there! Now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_02_any_04">Nice work, folks. Now what you&apos;re looking for are paintings with red stickers. Those are the ones the democrat wants. Get at least four. </string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_07_02">If we get outta this one I might just leave this fuckin&apos; town.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_05_01">Great, now you just need to find the second one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_49_01">Can&apos;t figure out why, but it looks like they&apos;ve got one of the boxes in the bio-lab.$NL;You&apos;ve got your vaccinations already, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_03_01">Ahhh! That old asshole is on his way back. Good work. If you can find some of my packages... Vlad would be very grateful.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_10_03">WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT...oh, the balloon. Right. Coming in two minutes!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_01_02">You chops ready for a cookout? Used to throw a good braai in my Cape Town days, but this is a bit different!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_23_03">Nice. That&apos;s it. Alright, one of you guys monkey up there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_22_any_04">Caustic soda - yep, thats it. Go for it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_59_03">Get upstairs, crew! That&apos;s where you&apos;ll be blasting through!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_19_02">Bravo! Now, second step - find the local security station, cut through and approve the opening sequence.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_16_03">Are you so dumb that the third pallet - a fucking inanimated object - can hide from you? Find that cunt.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_04_02">Crew, you got the goats, now hit the gas!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_05_03">About one minute until the customer arrives.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_02_01">Find your way inside and locate the Murkywater trains. The EMP parts will most likely be in different wagons.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_11_01">Get to that storage unit, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_07_01">Ernesto Sosa has a special lock system for his office, with a spoken pass phrase. But I have planned for it - I had my people sell some special cocaine to him, with a microphone recorder hidden in the package. See if you can find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_05_03">Good. Use the keycard to enter the server room on the second floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_07_02">Gang, snatch the bag and dump it by the methlab.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_07_09">Stop! You didn&apos;t put it in yet, did you?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_125_01">That&apos;s our ship. The Moretta. But we can&apos;t get on it from here. You gotta move it to dock 3B.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_11_01">Vault door&apos;s open. Get in and grab the loot!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_59_any_01">I&apos;m off in one minute.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_57_02">The vault code reshuffles every 10 minutes for extra security. Put a blocker on the keypad to lock the code in place.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_47_03">Garrett is back in his office. We need to keep him out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_138_02">This is reception. Remember where it is.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_05_any_02">Who wants to do a little banking?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_83_01">OK, now reactivate the computer. </string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_14_03">The code is likely in the auctioneer&apos;s office, but you gotta get in there first. The auctioneer probably has a keycard to open the door.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_04_02">I&apos;m inside. Keep them fuckers off me while I work. </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_28_03">C&apos;mon friends, the manual should show what wires you need to cut.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_35_01">I felt the tremor of that starting from here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_49_01">You need to get the computer running again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_cash_stage1_intro_a_01">OK, the thermal drill you need for the vault is somewhere in the parking lot. Get it before you do your takedown. Then you can go hit that vault. Watch for cameras and bank employees. Do your homework before you go in and remember cash is king.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_69_01">And another one bites the dust! Nice!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_48_01">...grab some of that gold if you can friends, but remember that money is secondary, yeah? </string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_16_01">Christ, LA&apos;s wrecked. Rubble everywhere.</string>
	 <string id="vit_intro_01_09">Oh, fuck me...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_15_03">The gas will clear away. Give it a moment. </string>
	 <string id="pln_run_19_02">Find more gas and pour it on the fire. Keep it burning! Fry him!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_76_01">Those lights... gotta mean something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_10_01">To get there, you need to get past the security door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_76_02">SWAT&apos;s on the roofs, guys. Don&apos;t let them get dug in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_20_02">Maybe check the walls?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_83_01">Found a saw yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_07_any_01">We have to hurry! The cop&apos;s radio is buzzing like crazy. They&apos;re already on their way!</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cr3_02_02">Going to refill the tank. Back soon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_31_02">Get to the pillar!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_02_any_02">OK, no time to lose, get all that intel.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage2_11_any_01">Looks like they burned the intelligence, we&apos;ll have to leave empty-handed!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_14_03">Remember what you&apos;re looking for. Big pile of cash. Shit big pile.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_13_01">We need the Moretta&apos;s comm frequency. It&apos;ll be on one of those terminals. Get checking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_74_01">Restore the power, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage3_13_any_01">Watch out for that chopper, it&apos;s close enough for the cops to do him some good damage.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_04_02">...See if you can open the doors via electrical boxes. Should be a couple nearby on the walls.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_65_01">Blerrie! The auctioneer has run off so you gotta use a drill instead. Get one on the door right away.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_04_01">Great! We don&apos;t want to alert the crowd so we&apos;re gonna detonate the C4 in time with Alesso&apos;s pyrotechnics. Head up to the tech booth and hack in.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_16_02b">I need to get into the garage and you need to protect me. Let&apos;s go, come on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_28_02">Cop is trying to move a goat out of the AO.</string>
	 <string id="plt_run_03_01">Ok, I&apos;m here and ready to get the hell out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_30_03">Don&apos;t wait too long friends, enter that code ASAP.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_18_01">Guys, head back to the security door and use the blowtorch.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_12_03">Wait, don&apos;t shoot! Make him give up instead by intimidating him. He can be useful to us.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_05_02">The daily code for the time lock on the vault. Should I send someone over?</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap01_02">It&apos;s just like you said. Cameras and microphones in every room. Buluc is one sick fucker.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_06_03">The alarm timer will start as soon as you open a door or window. That&apos;ll give you a few seconds to disable the alarm.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_55_03">No, that&apos;s the wrong blend... now you gotta wait until the reaction dies down and start again, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_end_b_02">That&apos;s enough coke, not all, but enough! Hectors people are at the harbor. You need to meet them and get the stuff onto their boat. Then call it a day - OK, a payday!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_23_02">Great job, Alex, I knew you&apos;d do it. </string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_02_02">Goddamnit! Can you guys move that?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_103_02">I got you a garbage truck, now you just gotta fill it with loot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_52_02">That&apos;s all we need. Up to you if you want to go for more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_11_03">Damn! They lowered the Diamond into the floor! No time for anything fancy, so only one thing for it - get a drill on there! </string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_60_any_03">I&apos;m leaving in half a minute!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_14_05">Mortgage foreclosures  revoked! No codes though. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_09">Woops. That one&apos;s on me I assume.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_brief_02">Hector wants to send a message in, quote en quote, blood and fire to the Mendoza cartel as they roll into their private airport. Might be tricky... But I think we can.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_53_01">I know it is an imposition, but do you think you could connect the fuel hose to the helicopter?</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_21_09">Alesso has promised a legendary gig. I&apos;m promising we&apos;ll deliver a legendary heist.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_54_03">If he doesn&apos;t follow orders. Hit him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_35_02">Good, now do your little magic on that baby. Get the pick-up running!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_19_03">Just little fuel to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_cnc_01_03">A jewelry store downtown could use a visit. Something for you guys?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_17_03">This door has a two-stage security protocol. First stage is using the keycard. So...if you please.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_08b_any_01">Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_12_02">If you plug me into the lobby computer, I can hack the door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_91_01">Get going or you&apos;re gonna be be left for dead!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_32_04">The keys, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_intro_01_03">Here we are, get in there and get me required amount. We go in quiet and go out with a boom!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_32_01">Careful guys, time&apos;s running out! 10 seconds!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_07_02">Great, that one&apos;s hacked. Get that crate closed, then find another.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_129_01">Five</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_27_03">Get the code from the screen and open the vault, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_06_01">Good work! Chopper&apos;s gonna drop him off then come back for the rest of you. While you&apos;re waiting, look around the forest for any more packages.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_29_any_01">OK! you&apos;ve got enough... Or you can stay for more.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_16_01">The workstation, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_169_02">That&apos;s one socket, but that big beautiful girl needs another.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_74_02">You need to reconnect the juice!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_81_02">Those crafty fuckers are dropping grenades into the sewers. </string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_10_03">He did it, gang. You can grab more loot if you want or you get on those bikes and escape!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_32_01">Cops are going for the balloon! Stop them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_09_any_01">Guys, we need to get that safe open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_55_01">Guys, be careful. The guards inside will probably carry pagers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_16_03">That&apos;s the last one. Now you can get far away, or return to the warehouse for more loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_21_02">Here&apos;s Johnny!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_08_01">Alright, that&apos;s our blackmailer dealt with. Let&apos;s hustle those other bags, before he gets greedy.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap03_03a">I promised my wife I would make you pay. Don&apos;t you forget.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_108_01">You must have triggered a failsafe. Use a drill to get out again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_12_02">There will be a computer in one of the staff rooms that we can hack. Find it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_04_02">Ooh, friends. Looks like rain is coming. Don&apos;t want to ruin those nice Murky uniforms, so get inside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_52_03">You need to get through that door, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_88_01">Looks like they&apos;ve upped the security. Gotta find a way to get the shutters open without making a mess of the oval office.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_17_02">Get in there, and just mess the place up. Trash the rooms, light up the cars - whatever you can do. Go crazy. The Commissar is bound to give us a call.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_13_02">I&apos;ve stowed some plastic explosive in the DeLorean. You can use it to make that gas station go up like the Tsar Bomba!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_13_03">Open sesame! I got some of the house&apos;s shutters to open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_24_02">Gang, cops have set up a three block perimeter. The hard way through is the only way, so you&apos;re boots on the ground. Stay with the truck, and the truck will stay with you. </string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_69_02">They&apos;re stamping the fire out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_79_01">Find something to take that cell block door down!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_49_03">You&apos;ll probably find the tunnel if you look around outside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_74_01">Right, time to get the master code. The CFO will have it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_37_01">Ach, watch it, friends! Of course. They have lasers in the bank that&apos;s supposed to only have older, primitive security. Let me check something... yes... you should be able to shut them off from the roof!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_28_01">Keep looking for that safe, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_114_01">One of BFD&apos;s coolant tanks is empty. She needs that water, guys. Grab a refill from the bathrooms!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_06_03">Why you sacks of wretched Yankee dick. You die today!</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_20_any_01">I have to leave in two minutes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_brief_01b">No surprise security&apos;s going to be real tight, so we&apos;ll airdrop in instead of driving. Quiet and deadly. Find the engine, and i&apos;ll have it flown out. Good luck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_84_02">Two</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_08_03">You need to help the Captain, cut the door open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_85_02">Three</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_35_03">The alarm. But no matter. We got enough cash. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_132_02">Eight!</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_16_01">Come on, what the fuck are you waiting for? Get in the truck!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_end_a_02">Outstanding work. Tonight, you clowns made yourself a friend in high places. You&apos;ll never pay another parking ticket in this town.</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_02_02">Damn it, we&apos;ve been double-crossed. You&apos;ve got incoming, get ready to fight.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap02_01c">Wait, wait. Listen to this...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_12_01">They&apos;re making a last effort. Make sure to stay away from that helicopter!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_end_01_01">Outstanding work! These sweet motors will be in the hands of Arabian sheikhs within the week. Good job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_45_01">Yeah, tell him his ass is on the line if he isn&apos;t available for the regular time-lock check in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_27_02">Plan B guys. Go find the teddy bear, rip it open and use the saw inside to cut open the ICU doors.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_06_any_03">We&apos;re locked down... if you want me to open it up you need to get the surveilance room open fast.</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_01_any_01">Hello gentlemen. Our client is very pleased that you agreed to do this with us. But know this - the only way this is going through is if we do it our way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_cafe_30secs_to_departure_subway_01">30 seconds, get to the entrance!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_18_03">Look, up in the scaffold! Another goat. But, hold up! It looks like that ladder is electrocuted. Disable power!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_45_02">Chopper&apos;s here, guys. Start hauling the loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_14_02">Now stow those bags in the container on the floor. I&apos;m sure I can find someone to collect it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_67_01">It&apos;s ugly business, but it&apos;s gotta be done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_end_a_03">FBI in disarray. A lot of people about to get called into their bosses&apos; office. Mendoza crippled and we&apos;re about to get paid. Nice burn, folks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_14_01">Yeah.. I ... I don&apos;t know .. It could have been a big gun.</string>
	 <string id="crn_man_02_01">I got it. Hoisting it your way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_29_02">Now, you ready to call it? Find our Insider. She&apos;s going to show you a way to slip out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_02_02">Charon gave us a password for a laptop that contains data on where the money is. Find it!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_09_01">Something wrong with pump.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_08d_01">You&apos;ve defeated the eighth wave of cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_11_03">Vault&apos;s open. Grab whatever&apos;s inside, gang!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_16_03">Hooked into the terminal yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_48_03">There goes the connection. Power was cut. Please restore it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_01_03">Let&apos;s keep this one under the radar.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_34_02">You gotta hack into the gate controls.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_09_01">Kerels are sending in Medic Dozers with this round.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_04_02">Ach, I should&apos;ve known they would have it locked. Maybe have a look in the clubhouse and see if you can find any clues to the code in the briefing room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_28_01">Blerrie that&apos;s an OLD vault! Almost a shame to blow it open, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_50_02">The safe is probably opened by a button or switch somewhere. You need to find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_02_any_02">Come on let&apos;s get a move on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_64_03">C&apos;mon now, get in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_87_01">Four bags. Hustle! Hustle!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_14_02">Look around. There should be clues that will point you to the right truck. Perhaps matching their color to the containers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_40_02">Hurry, friends! Get into that plane.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_intro_01">Trying to find some good recipies here... some of Bain&apos;s files are a blerrie mess, so I hope I get it sorted!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_09_03">Two down, two to go!</string>
	 <string id="plt_run_01_01">Ok guys... the buildings here make it hard to get close. You need to move to a higher position so I can pick you up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_51_03">Just bring thoses bags to the chopper, dear friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_101_01">You need to shut down those guns for Bile to get you out. Find the control boxes and shut them down.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_21_04">You&apos;ve got to find the cell block.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_arrival_van">Alright the van is there. Move!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_51_03">We are done, gang. Time to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_25_03">Hacking now. Need a minute or two.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_31_02">Come on, get to that garage.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_123_01">This is Roberts Bank. How may I help you today?</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_07_03">That reads correct. Thanks for your assistance.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_113_01">Go! Get to the ladder before this place comes crashing down!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_59_01">Blerrie! You gotta get that vehicle out of the way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_03_01">Right, that&apos;s the files. Get them back to Hoxton!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_84_02">Look for a code that starts with three.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_125_03">The Moretta - That&apos;s our girl. But we can&apos;t get on board here. You have to see her moved to dock 3B.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_25_02">Ok, it&apos;s like I thought... blerrie amateurs. See if you can find that USB stick.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_66_02">OK, time to take your masks off and make your way casually out the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_72_03">You gotta restart the hack!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_13_any_01">Alright, bring it to the van, it&apos;s right across the street.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_end_a_02">Terrific. Because of you we know where all the Mendoza cash is stashed. It&apos;s one of the Trustee branch banks. I guess you know what comes next, huh?</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_04_01">Looks like one of the goats is up in that apartment. Get up there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_23_01">So, as you surely know, this isn&apos;t everything this safe house has to offer, let me show you what I&apos;m working on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_64_04">Got to get that cannon pointing right.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_52a_02">They got to the power line. Reset the breaker switch!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_11_04">Go find the evidence storage. It&apos;s on the second floor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_19_02">Your first priority is finding your ride out of there. Maybe check the hangars, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_11_03">You screwed that pooch good, asshole.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_08_08">Hey, assholes. I&apos;m enjoying a Martini in here! How you like that?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_04_03">IT are nearby. Get over there, find the server and haul it back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_55_01">There&apos;s goes the alarm. And our stealth plan. Don&apos;t sweat it. The ship is moving.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_31_02">You&apos;re too close to finishing to fuck up now. Just slap the paste onto the grate and burn through!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_47_02">You got the briefcase? Excellent! Time to go then!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_11_03">Check the shoe store&apos;s stock in the computer.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_58_06">We could have done with you guys in Rhodesia.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_03_04">It&apos;s muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_111_01">OK, you chops. Time to bring in the Beast!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_13_any_01">Damn it! They saw you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage3_03_any_01">There are Heavy FBI units all over the place, be careful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_04_03">Vlad wants to talk to you...</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_66_02">Only two of you at a time up the zipline, please. And it&apos;s a one way trip. But what a trip, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_71_03">Commissar&apos;s hiding at Downtown. Look for a clue for that. He&apos;s Downtown.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_14_03">Alright, you found him! Now get him to the top of that tower!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_20_03">To cover our escape, you gotta set a fire trap in container 12. Use gas.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_e_05">That should get the process going.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_35_03">Great. Poppa Bain will take care of these. Now, back to the keys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_14_01">OK, now you need to get your hands on the keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_10_01">The mechanic&apos;s done. If you want more loot you get it now, otherwise you ride out of there. </string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_30secs_to_arrival_van">The van will be there in 30 seconds - get ready!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_03_02">I can&apos;t move until you deal with the snipers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_72_01">Guys, don&apos;t forget: douse those cars with gasoline. Light &apos;em up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_62_03">The window cleaning platform is a no-go. Use ziplines to get the bags out instead. </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_08a_01">Ok, now find Wilson&apos;s code lock.</string>
	 <string id="plt_flt_01_03">All right, I&apos;m close now, but there&apos;s snipers spread around the drop zone. I&apos;ll need you to take care of those before I can drop the C4.</string>
	 <string id="txm_man_02_03">... Great. I&apos;ll go get the server.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_14_any_01">Be careful! They have snipers incoming!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_06_03">What, are you afraid of those spiders in the corner? Search more thoroughly for that code, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_79_06">This piece of junk is from the 70&apos;s. Hurry up...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_29_02">This guy is doing well. Let&apos;s loot the place. We&apos;re gonna go for his floor safe. You&apos;ve got some winches stashed near the entrance to the property. Get them and hook &apos;em up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_28_03">You can either look for more loot or get out of there now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_02h">Fuck this, why are we talking about donuts? Feds eat pie.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_09_04">Next step is to code the tag. Get it to the computer!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_17_01">Something in the cafeteria and it isn&apos;t Jeff Vader. It looks like a glowing LCD display. </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_12_01">Found that safe, yet friends?</string>
	 <string id="pt2_cs1_01_01">On my way, Sensei. Does this thing have afterburners?</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_33_02">Left and middle!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_18_03">Have a closer look at that shrine.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_end_b_01b">I&apos;ll set up the trade with the senator&apos;s people and get us rolling.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_19_02">Take down the alarm, friends. </string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_06_07">Keep firing and I can get the gate open!</string>
	 <string id="plt_flt_01_02">I&apos;m close, guys, but the cops brought in a lot of snipers on the roofs of the nearby buildings. Gonna need you to take care of them before I can make the drop.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_05_03">On the scene! Bring me the goats!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_57_01">I&apos;ve got someone waiting for you ouside in the sewers. You&apos;ll need some thermite to get through.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_23_01">You should be able to access the vault somewhere around there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_91_02">The van can&apos;t get through unless you clear the area.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_45_02">Not sure they&apos;re the same as the others.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_22_03">Turn those valves off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_27_01">Gang, there&apos;s got to be something in the motelrooms that can pinpoint the Commissar&apos;s location. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_44_02a">Oh, blerrie...</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_06_any_03">Boat&apos;s moving, he&apos;ll be at dock 8 by the warehouse.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_08_01">Great job, gang. The mobsters are dead or running. That&apos;s how we do it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_54_03">They&apos;re throwing everything into this. Hold them off, my friends. They&apos;ll kill you, but they&apos;ll fuck me proper. For sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_58_03">Don&apos;t break his jaw!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_44_03">It might&apos;ve been misplaced- check everywhere!</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_22_02">Thank you! Thank you!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_35_01">Open sesame, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_15_01">Time to slip out of there! No reason to go loud now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_39_02a"> Yes, Duke lent me a book. But exactly why are these things so important, aside from their considerable monetary value?</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_05_01">I need to open this door. Give me a minute!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_end_a_04">Disco inferno. Nicely done. Let&apos;s get paid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_26_any_01">Good job, we are gone.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_04_03">Defend the drill. Should be through in a couple of minutes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_18_04">Admire the decor later. Get inside the Oval Office and find that keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_05_03">OK, good. Now take care of the other router.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_34_any_01">Get that server anyway you can!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_56_02">Any room in the sanctum might have what we need. Look around!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_30_02">Thermite has burned through, yeah? Time to get that winch set up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_03_01">Okay. That&apos;s him barbecuing.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_14_01">Okay. Here we go again. This is for the money, baby!</string>
	 <string id="sla_trk_ready_02">Yeah, ready!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_49_02">Looks like we&apos;re in the right place, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_56_01">Bekakin&apos; kerels messed it up for you! You&apos;re going to have to start over.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_03_02">He&apos;s by the barbecue. Get over to him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_end_a_03">That was close. Good work disposing of those guns. Hector will move in his army now and we will have a very fine payday indeed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_11_01">You&apos;re gonna need the thermite to pop the wagon open. Get back and grab it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_gwd_01">Great job! You beat them back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_01_03">First, you gotta break into the warehouse. It&apos;d be great if you can keep the noise down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_15_01">Look inside the containers. Find what cargo they&apos;re carrying. Maybe that could help you figure out which is the right truck.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_44_01">Ag man, that was the wrong code!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_16_01">The wheel stopped on the dozer again. Watch out guys!</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_12_03">Ah, come on! We&apos;re missing a server. According to the log, it was taken to IT. Get over there, and grab it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_48_01">SWATS from the west!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_01_02">Come on, gang. Out of that hidey-hole!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_03_02">If you cut power to the nearby electric box, those detectors should go down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_74_02">OK, find the CFO. He&apos;s got the master code!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_18">Yeah my gut feeling told me that wasn&apos;t the right ingredient...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_intro_01_01">A night at the museum, gang. It&apos;s just you, a crew of security guards and a priceless diamond.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_19_01">Find the scotch and spike it. Red bottle.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_77_03">The C4 is in play, gang. Grab it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_68_02">The Murky resources we&apos;re after will be in the form of drugs. They could be anywhere around there, so you&apos;re just going to have to start looking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_09_01">Those lights. Some kind of indicator. Look around and see if you can match them with anything.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_35_01">Now cut him loose.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_14_any_01">You&apos;re inside? Good job, now there is only one more door between us and the server.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_29_01">Damn! This was the wrong pc! Cops are on their way. You don&apos;t have much time now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_123_01">The comm frequency ain&apos;t here. Check the computer&apos;s in the control room across the dockyard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage3_08_any_01">The bus blew up! Be careful and stay out of that fire!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_27_03">Drill that gate, guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_136_02">Hurry now, take all the pardons so we can leave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_48_02">You can use that keycard in the control room. Just swipe it, open the dock.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_25_01">Groot, that&apos;s all we need. Murkywater and the Dentist will be in big trouble once this hits home.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_141_03">Time to go! Get on board before Murky attack craft reach us!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_57_03">Did you forget about the alarm I mentioned earlier?! You needed to disable it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_21_05">The walls are thick concrete, but I can still hear that concert. Nothing stops the music, huh.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_18_01">Thirty seconds, gang! You&apos;re pushing it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_25_02">Remember, you need a gas can to set the paintings on fire. Shoot the gas can.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_09">These fuckers went to driving school - I&apos;ll tell you that much!</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_05_05">Hold that door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_gold_a_intro_a_07">Gold, gold, gold. Let&apos;s go dig in the vault, shall we?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_14_01">Damn! Someone saw the body! Take him out before he calls it in!</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt2_03_02">Hey, we&apos;re missing some of the goats. This makes Vlad sad. Trust me, you want a happy Vlad.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_07_04">Ach no, that&apos;s not it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_14_01">There have to be clues around the wharf that&apos;ll help you figure out which truck is carrying the machines to Washington. Keep your eyes peeled.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_20_any_01">Add muriatic acid, to continue the process!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_40_02">That diner has a service ladder leading up to the roof, but you&apos;ll need a keycard to get to it. Look around for one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_22_02">The plane should be on its way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_22_03">I admire your attitude. Your dedication will pay off.</string>
	 <string id="bkl_brn_intro_01">Look at you motherfuckers just walking in here with your stupid ass-masks. I can&apos;t fucking believe Rust wants to be one of you freaks. Regardless, two things are gonna go down now. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_c1_03">Soda. Caustic soda.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_29_03">Now you can take that code and enter it into the keypad on the safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_25_01">That goat climbed up there. Got stuck. We need him down. Saw the streetlight!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_02_03">Hoxton&apos;s rottin&apos; in a cell, and you&apos;re scratching your ass in there. Out of the crate!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_29_01">There&apos;s gotta be something special about that thing if they keep it locked up in here. Maybe take it with you, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_end_02_01">Well, you got a decent amount. Just about covers the gas money. Maybe next time we can push it further.</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_04_03">Locke sold the Butcher out too. The ship by the dock is one of hers. Go help &apos;em out and maybe we can hitch a boat-ride.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_50_03">Now you gotta blow a hole into the floor, yeah? What we&apos;re after is in the foundation of the building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_cnc_01">You&apos;re going to New York on a rescue mission for the Continental.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_02_05">Give Santa a good thrashing! Wake him up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_09_02">Good work, gang - but the NYPD won&apos;t give up so easily.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_11_02">Hey, where&apos;s the Diamond? They&apos;ve lowered it into the floor! Wasn&apos;t expecting that. Calls for brutal method - break through with a drill!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_54_03">You could take a look in the bookshelves.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_35_01">You need to find Buluc&apos;s office.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_57_any_03">This spot is getting deadly!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_random_stage1_brief_02b">You&apos;re going to need to get into the vault using a thermal drill, get whatever&apos;s in there bagged up and moved back to the escape car. Use your judgment and don&apos;t be greedy... Good luck, folks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_09_any_01">Your escape helicopter is here,I suggest you get the hell out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_45_02">OK, I&apos;m going to need a little bit of time.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_12_10">You should always trust Locke, except when you shouldn&apos;t.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_22_06">Keep your eyes on the hostage!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_key_02_01">Have you found the key yet?</string>
	 <string id="plt_as1_intro_01_03">You guys ready? This is where you get out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_76_02">The pilot will need a signal where to drop the Beast. Drop some smoke!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_02_01">OK, we&apos;re moving. Now keep the truck out of danger &apos;til you&apos;re clear.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_brief_02c">We go to their little private airport, find the weapons and take them all or destroy them... But it&apos;s more profitable if we take them.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_04_01">So Ernesto Sosa is hiding behind his guards. You can handle it, I&apos;m sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_02_01">Well, what does a goat sound like?</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_01_03">Ok, find Santa and free him!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_17">It&apos;s the police! They&apos;re tailing us!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_end_b_01">Things got messy, but you got through in the end. The hacks worked. It looks like the good lady Mayor&apos;s people was behind this. The press are already sharpening the knives for Schwartz. Needless to say, The Elephant is ecstatic. You have served your city well tonight, my friends.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_05_06">You guys did a great job up there. You wanna join the road crew?</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_06_01">You gotta fight your way past the cops and meet up with Eddie. Move!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_19_01">Okay. Well, you know where it is, but I don&apos;t fucking know. Light a flare, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_32_03">Lost it! Get the power back, quick!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_09_any_01">Chopper is there, throw the bags into the chopper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_03_02">The cocaine is in the manager&apos;s office, but keep your eyes open for hired muscle.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_86_02">Those federales are going to want to stop the Beast. Don&apos;t let them!</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_06_01">Ok, let&apos;s drop the next one right into the lobby. Circling back.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_end_stealth_01">Beautiful work, friends. You made less noise than my cat on that one. Now let&apos;s see what we can do with that artifact, yeah? Duke will get to looking at it as soon as you get back to the safehouse. </string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_03">Shit!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_08_01">Are you afraid of the receptionists or something? Get in there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_79_04">You&apos;ve only got a small bit of time before the kerels find you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_04_02">Let me give your memories a jog, yeah? Open the cargo bay door. Please.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_66_03">Go ahead and grab what you can, then leave when you are ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_31_03">There&apos;ll likely be workers here. Don&apos;t let them blow this.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_03_09">Can we get back to work yet? I&apos;m down to 5% on my cell.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_46_01">Almost there. You should be able to hear it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_25_05">Guys, if the Commissar gets away, Hoxton will rot. So move it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_01_03">Time for a nice, old fashioned cookout, for sure!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_end_01">Nicely done, dear friends. We&apos;re still in a lot of trouble but old Locke is going to take care of you, yeah? I know I made some promises, and I&apos;m still working on getting answers. Calling in all my favors for this one. Gotta pay off the Butcher too- don&apos;t want her nipping at our heels after Alaska. Have a short breather, lay low for a bit, while Mr Lindenhurst tries to figure out what&apos;s so special about this medallion dinges. I got a feeling that we haven&apos;t even cut through the frosting on this cake, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_01_02">Okay, there it is. Kick the door down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_22_02">The keycard grants us access. Use it to open the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_08_06">Starting to feel like a nagging nanny here... so find that laptop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_brief_01">OK, the cameras are installed in the paintings. We&apos;re ready. The senator&apos;s men are jumpy but ready to deal with us. So let&apos;s deal. Money for art.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_65_02">More Russians on the way. Vans coming around the corner!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_56_03">If you want, grab some sapphires on the way out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_81_02">That&apos;s both crates found, yeah? Good! Time to get the hell out if there. Make your way back to the entrance so I can arrange your extraction.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_58_03">You need to restart the detonator.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_23_03">Excellent. We&apos;re almost done. Bear with me.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_19_06">Stop this madness and lay down your weapons!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_14_03">It&apos;s working. Keep it that way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_03">...IF my calculations are correct.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_02_02">I&apos;m a sitting duck here with those snipers. Can you do something?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58c_01">OK guys, time to leave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_07_08">You gotta saw those trucks open to find the target!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_25_02">That&apos;s the first.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_31_any_01">Use the camera to see when they turn on, and then turn them off again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_01_any_02">Head over to the phone, the phone&apos;s ringing. Make the contact there.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_66_any_04">That&apos;s close enough! I&apos;ll get it!</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_02_02">You found it. Good! Good. I knew I could depend on you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_75_02">Now pop the manhole! We&apos;re getting out through the sewers!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_30_01">Enter the code, friends. Have you forgotten it or something?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_94_02">Boat&apos;s waiting for you. Get there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_16_01">Cut the electricity, friends.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_01">Fuck!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_11_03">You brought gold, frankincense and myrrh. Myrrh coke to Vlad!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_77_01">The alarm has put a time lock on the door. You just gotta wait it out, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_03_03">Those are the jewels we are after. Get it to the van.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_20_03">Military blueprints in a high security transport? I&apos;ll see what I can find.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_36_any_03">Control the civilians!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_125_01">One</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_25_03">Check two overrides, two more to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_11_01">Power&apos;s back. Get to the terminal and restart the download!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_57_01">Those are the right servers, but if you find the IT guy, we can get in faster.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_09_02">Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;ll lead the way.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cr3_02_01">Tank&apos;s dry. Going to refill. </string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_09_01">Hey, I just got word. Cabot&apos;s got a guy comin&apos; to pick us up but you guys better split before he gets here. He ain&apos;t too happy right now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_02_03">Mitchell&apos;s the one in the pink shirt.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_38_02">You need to open the runway gates. It&apos;s gonna be jol, and the Murkys will go crazy when we take off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_23_01">And that&apos;s the second batch of C4. Almost there. Find the last batch.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_04_01">Damn, the fat rat&apos;s riding the elevator. After him! Catch him before he gets away!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_28_01">Quick into that room, you see the safe?</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_02_03">Focus on finding the trains containing the EMP bomb parts. That&apos;s our main priority.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_20_01">Damn! The zip-line is useless now. Forget about securing loot on it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_09_03">See if you can find weak spot on the second floor, yeah? Use the scaffolding.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_25_01">You gotta get that code.</string>
	 <string id="plt_flt_01_01">OK, I&apos;m in the area, but the cops got snipers on the roofs all around the building. You need to get rid of those before I can drop the C4.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_65_06">What&apos;s up guys? Find those routers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_13_03">Keycards can be a great asset. Find &apos;em, but use &apos;em carefully. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_33_03">Alright. Now find the test-subjects, and get them to the scanner. You are looking for some bald guys.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_22_any_01">Hey! Dock eight, guys!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_04_01a">Maybe you tell me what is going on with Bain and what you have planned next?$NL;</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_38_02">Now detonate the C4 in the main hall. Place it right above the vault. Hard to say exactly where that is. Two possible spots. Pray for a bit of luck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_11_02">All right, gang. I&apos;ve found some terminals that might have a suitable code. I need you to run a little hack on them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_116_03">BFD will break down if she gets too hot. Keep them water tanks full.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_30_02">Knock knock! Now find the prisoner!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_89_02">Look for a code that starts with eight.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_13_any_03">Vlad&apos;s wife will be thrilled - now get that thing outta there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_22_02">Good thinking. We&apos;re using that to get the money out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_75_01">Open the hatch and move into the sewers, they won&apos;t see this coming</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_03c">Remember friends, we&apos;re doing this for Bain. Even if it&apos;s fun making Garrett go bossies, we&apos;ve got to take down his plans.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_09_03">The PC is showing where the trucks are headed. Keep an eye out for those bound for Washington.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_38_02">Unless you&apos;re waiting for a somersaulting chupacabra in a catsuit to help, you need to get to the roof and shut down those lasers, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_36_01">Okay, scanning is under way. Now make sure it gets to finish without getting interrupted.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_10_01">Oh, you&apos;re going to give old Locke a heart attack. That was a close one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_12_04">Hurry up! Move to the next building.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_14_02">Some moorings still not removed. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_26_03">Now just wait for his reaction.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_30_02">There&apos;s the way out, gang. Fresh air awaits.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_11a_02">I&apos;m sure there are wiring cases for the gate nearby.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_31_06">Go to the pillar guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_32_01">Look like the power is back, gang. </string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_01_04">I heard ya. We&apos;re moving!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_intro_03">I will hold you to that, you chop!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_18_02">Gang, you see it? Another goat in the scaffolds! But - woah, be careful! Looks like that ladder is electrocuted!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_97_01">Shit guys! They got an aircraft launching rockets!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_105_01">Get those wires connected to the car asap!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_40_02">Remember to watch out for the guards.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_48_01">Great, now just hold the fort until the thermite is done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_19_02">You snatched a decent amount of bags there. Well done!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_38_03">Head for the vault and open that baby up with the keycard and code.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_40_02">Not sure, but it&apos;s probably the right one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_28_04">Very nice! A door breaker!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_14_01">OK, now get that footage back to the van. Move it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_29_any_01">OK, escape is here. You need to push through the cops - there is no other way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_04_03">It&apos;s the cops! Hold the line!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_09a_01">Hey, this piece of shit Buluc... he likes riddles and cryptic things. </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_38_02">Let me remind you - look for a ladder. </string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_85_any_01">Nice. Now start her up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_05_02">We can only proceed once you have acquired those items, my friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_08_08">It has got to be muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_intro_01_02">Orientation guys; Get off point gas station, banks straight ahead, garage right, grocery store left. Go get rich.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_35_01">That&apos;s the alarm, but we got enough out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_29_02">Somebody, grab the phone and let me handle it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_21_02">Right, now let&apos;s see if he took the bait.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_23_any_03">We don&apos;t have long. The cops are coming now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_05_02">SWAT on their way. Guess they wanted to talk to Commissar about the battle at the motel.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_126_01">Two</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_39_01">Come on, gentlemen! Don&apos;t be shy! Come and say hello.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_62_03">Find that weapons lab yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_113_03">We&apos;re after the vault, so please get me a closer look at it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_54_03">The Sosas were sending more men in to reinforce security, and it seems they&apos;re about to arrive now! Make sure you haven&apos;t left any bodies lying around in plain view, or they&apos;ll find out you&apos;re here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_20_01">Okay, that&apos;s one keycard. Hunt down the other.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap02_03">Fuck you, go fucking drown in vodka. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_38_01">Goddamn it! We want that cage on the roof. It&apos;s the most defensible spot around.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_77_02">Maybe look in the back?</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_21_02">Where. Are. The. Shoes? Where?!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_41_01">Open the valve! </string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_39_03">That airlock probably goes to the PEOC. </string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_05_01b">Not like this, not like this...</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_34_01">Nailed it. Keep going guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_08_01">Damn, it&apos;s the cops! Just what we need!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_54_01">What&apos;s that? Russian loot? Get it to the DeLorean. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_15_03">Get on ship everyone. We must leave now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_28_02">Ah crap. The plane&apos;s got to ditch. Alright, we&apos;re switching plans.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_15_any_06">Gotta be faster, boys. Getaway is gone.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_25_02">I&apos;m in. Just gimme a minute.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_03_05">Make your way to the front, guys. Come on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_29_03">C4&apos;s gonna explode now! Get out of the way!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_11_03">Please? Attach the detonator?</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_41_01">Blerrie! The kerels got to the winch!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_10_02">There you go friends, now go back and open up the gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_09_02">That computer is showing which truck is going where. Could be valuable to know that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_21_02">Guys, the turret - take it apart.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_19_01">We gotta get in. A drill won&apos;t do it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_04_any_01">That&apos;s the bus, take them all out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_21_01">Get out there and use the crane, friends.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_19_13">I think you underestimate me!</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_14_03">Come to think of it, I&apos;m kinda thirsty too. Be right back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_brief_01c">We can only get access to the vault with a password though, so find me some of his gadgets and I&apos;ll do the rest. Good luck.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_intro_04_02">They can keep wondering all they want. Payday business is no one else&apos;s.$NL;</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_36_07">Now grab the hose and pull it down to the safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_40_05">How far along are you on the vault? Use the card first, then enter the code.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_76_03">Get the code and open the vault, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_106_03">Great job guys, You can signal the chopper on the roof whenever you&apos;re ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_48_02">Okay. The controls. Hack &apos;em, and keep the cops off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_104_03">The code has three numbers, each color coded. You&apos;ll find them in computer briefcases.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_102_01">The drill is through. Open the safe!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_22_03">The keychain! Get it!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_03_02">You damn asshole bastards. I&apos;ll fucking kill you for this. You hear? Kill you!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_125_02">The dinges crashed, Can&apos;t figure out why...</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_14_any_01">...There&apos;s 3 Gensec security boxes we need to disable.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_20_02">Did he say Red Valley Red? Go find it in the wine store!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_34_03">Outstanding! That coke will be a nice bonus. Bag it, gang!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_88_01">Ach! The dinges has broken down. Get some spare parts and repair it!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_03_any_02">Nice!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_02b">Everybody knows the secret&apos;s in the glaze?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_36_03">No time to waste, we got to leave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_30_03">That&apos;s the exit, guys - to the right and down the stairs. Go! Go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_intro_a_03">OK, gallery&apos;s just ahead. Watch out for motion detectors, cameras and guards. Get in there and bring me four of the paintings marked with a red sold sticker. Time is ticking guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_13_any_01">Yes! Hack&apos;s done, everything should be unlocked now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_93_01">Awesome. Now just sit tight for 30 floors...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_05_03">That&apos;s one of the voting machines. Great job! Alright, when the coast is clear, get the hack started. </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_40_03">The roof of that diner can be accessed by a service ladder, but you&apos;re going to need a keycard to get to it. Surely there&apos;s one around somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_kb2_01">You&apos;ve got to keep at least 2 bags!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_21_any_11">I&apos;m coming in at dock nine!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_20_any_02">Alright, you got it, lets get out of here!</string>

	 <string id="pln_cr2_77_01">Grab that C4, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_01_03">Collateral damage will screw us. So no cops. That means keep it quiet. I&apos;ll let you know when you need to plant the C4.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_01_02">Into the dockyard, gang. Keep an eye out for security and cameras. Go.</string>

	 <string id="brs_pt2_03_05">Can I come out yet? Are they gone?</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_full_force_01">Those snipers couldn&apos;t stop you, so the cops are prapairing to move in with force. Get ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_19_01">Hold on guys, I&apos;m looking for a way out. If you cross the street you should be able to get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_04_any_06">I can only take one at a time...</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_29_03">Man, these boys got themselves a Franz-Jaeger safe. Wasn&apos;t expecting that! Okay....well, with what we got there&apos;s only one way we&apos;re cracking that - water!</string>
	 <string id="elp_election_brf_speak_02">Gentlemen - today we vote. They say: one man, one vote. I say: four men and lots of votes. I need you to rig the voting machines in my district.</string>

	 <string id="pln_tr1_05_03">Well done. It&apos;s all extra gravy, thanks to the US Army.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_07_04">Right now I wish I was some other guy on some other job.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_03_07">C&apos;mon man, either get me or send a cab.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_17_01">The keycard you collected earlier will initiate the opening of this airlock, which leads to the inner complex. Swipe that little kaka.</string>

	 <string id="pln_ed3_14_03">Open fucking sesame. Let&apos;s see what we have there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_19_03">Kwaai kwaai. Now secondly there should be a security station nearby. Head there and approve the opening.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_01_02">Thought you guys were stable? What the fuck happened back there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_27_03">Stop them following. Set off the trap!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_102_02">Half of them loaded.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_02_any_02">Is someone going to get that? Can&apos;t start the trade until you do..</string>

	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_brief_01c">What you&apos;re gonna do is go in, control the crowd, get into the vault without the alarms going off. Then set a fire, and film yourself doing it. Hector wants it that way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_36_02">Birthday boy Ralph is probably hiding somewhere pathetic.</string>

	 <string id="loc_bex_93_01">Clear out the gas.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_49_01">The place is booby trapped!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_43_02">Damn cops stalled the engine. Better get the pick-up moving again - quick!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_63_01">BFD&apos;s done. Now, down into the vault!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_intro_a_03">OK, the Mendoza bus is on the bridge, which means we land to take it out in ten minutes. Hit the bus, finish off their people, take the money. Simple.</string>

	 <string id="rb5_hb2_20_02">This case is special. Why am I special? Who&apos;s leaking this stuff?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_95_01">Any luck with those car keys?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_66_01">Now take off your masks and walk out the front door. Not too fast, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_37_01">Ah, that&apos;s what we came for. Nice and shiny. Send it out on a zipline, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_72_02">Find me the list, gang. Just plug it into an online terminal in IT.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_16_03">SHIELD! Get around him and take him out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_08_01">Now!</string>

	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_10_04">We need hydrogen chloride!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_28_01">Check the schematic and find the right wires!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_84_01">Bile can&apos;t pick you up while those guns are active. Find the control boxes and shut them down, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_95_02">The keycard will probably be in a safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_09_01">All right, the C4&apos;s on the ground. Grab it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_25_03">Driver is waiting on the street. Get Hox up there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_63_02">Aluminum and iron oxide... Beautiful.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_08_02">Ok, you&apos;re there. Now, see the RFID reader by the gate? Open it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_08_02">The evidence will be here somewhere. Search for it. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_92_02">Well done, friends!</string>

	 <string id="pln_jr1_05_03">Guys, look for a security room around there. Use the arc welder to cut through, and approve the sequence.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_13_01">Almost... there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_92_04">Once more, the code is...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_11_01">Drill is dropped. Get it. Get that vault open.</string>

	 <string id="pln_dah_92_05">Here it is again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_33_02">If the intel is correct the test subjects that you need to scan are identical.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_110_02">Party might be over. Lots of people leaving.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_62_02">Time to light it up, guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_intro_02">You need to get in there, get our man out, and destroy whatever incriminating evidence the kerels are keeping on him. Got it?</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_08">Keep on with the goat catching thing!</string>
	 <string id="btm_cs1_01_01">I&apos;ll be happy to help you. One moment, please.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_61_01">Your ride out is on the way, but keep those blerrie Federales at bay until it gets there!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_07b_any_06">... I hope you&apos;re ready!</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_11_01">Great. That&apos;s the first truck emptied. How are your backs feeling?</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_21_03">We pull this off, and the press will go nuts. Alesso. Payday Gang... badass.</string>

	 <string id="bot_gen_04a_any_02">I&apos;ll be there in three minutes...</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_08_any_01">That&apos;s the external hard drive. Nice.</string>

	 <string id="pln_ko1_24_03">Gage sorted a dumpster to stash a bit of loot in. His people will collect it in the morning.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_93_04">You need to get onboard the helicopter!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_04_01">Those shipping crates are sealed tighter than a gnat&apos;s asshole. You need to find something to break them open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_60_03">Friends, that did it! You can get in there and take the pardons!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_06_01">Keep going, guys. He gotta be around here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_11_any_01">Thats four, we&apos;re good to go now. If you want to get the rest of the paintings thats up to you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_44_03">See if you can find the car keys. They should be near.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_91_03">Your escape driver&apos;s parked up. Get back there - now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_04_05">It&apos;s caustic soda, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_08_03">You need to find that office. Look upstairs.</string>

	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_26_any_01">Confirmed! I&apos;m coming in at dock eight!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_25_any_01">Good, it&apos;s continuing. Keep an eye out, and keep defending...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_26_03">Uh... Not exactly Wonderland, is it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_26_02">Find a tool, then open the crate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_24_any_02">Ah, damn it. Close but now we got to rush it. </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_14_01">Come on, keep looking. There&apos;s only so many places it can be.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_01_02">Go inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_77_02">I&apos;ve recorded all of the information, access it by pressing that button.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_13_02">Can&apos;t do anything until you hook me up guys.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_28_03">Too much heat for me just make a break for it with the car. Gonna need some help guys.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_06_03">Got a nice clear run at the bridge. That&apos;s where the cage&apos;ll be.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_24_01">There it is. But step carefully! Those floor tiles are pressure sensitive. Don&apos;t step on them! You&apos;ll have to make a safe path across! Use the circuit box over there.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_62_any_04">That&apos;s it! I&apos;m off now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_40_03">If there&apos;s nothing left you want to take, hurry and get back to the car.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_19_01">Fuck me, there&apos;s a reference to a &quot;classified informant&quot; here. I fucking knew it.  I&apos;ll keep digging.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_63_any_04">They&apos;re attacking me! I&apos;m a sitting duck here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_12_02">...You&apos;ll need to find the box&apos;s shelf number by hacking a terminal in the computer lab.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_26_01">Get the crate open, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_09_02">Out into the sky, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_25_01">Ach, dwankie amateurs, keeping secure codes on USB sticks! Told you, didn&apos;t I? Have a look around and see if you can find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fourstores_stage1_end_b_04">Let&apos;s go to Vlad for the money. Good job getting your gang through that little mash up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_31_01">Damn it, so close!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_77_02">CFO to the roof, ASAP!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_23_03">The Christmas tree - that&apos;s where the loot goes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_26_03">Evening, this is Agent Green. Today&apos;s code seems incorrect. Just need to confirm.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_102_03">Hurry with those chems, you need to get through that door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_108_01">I don&apos;t know exactly where the entrance is, so you gotta look around for it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_24_any_01">Keep looking for that tiara!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_23_01">Man, the EMP took out the whole factory it seems... Use your flashlights and find the X-ray device.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_35_02">Someone alerted the cops. No matter. We got what we came for.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_end_c_03">Smooth operation team. You stole everything and the tiara. We are in town and are making a name for ourselves here. Great job.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_13_01">Found a clue to who has the card yet? It&apos;s probably written somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_26_01">Pigs will fly. </string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_25_01">See that statue - Lady Justice. Hand her some money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_20_any_01">1 remaining.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_15_02">Maybe the contents of those shipping containers can help you figure out which is our truck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_41_01">The gate has two control rooms. One on each side. This is the first.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_02_02">Fuuuck. Guys, come get me in the parking lot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_16_03">Why you still there? Come on, into the car and floor it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_27_any_01">I&apos;ll be back with a new position.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_76_01">Get the hell out dammit! Get to the manhole and into the sewers!</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap04_02">What is this?</string>
	 <string id="rb5_bph_intro_02b">I hope that piece-of-shit traitor Kento is up there. I really do.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_43_01">I&apos;ve got an idea. We hack the mainframe. We can probably get into it, even if there are several layers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_119_03">Just food for the rats now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_intro_01_02">Traffic is backed all the way along the southbound I45. If you were planning on getting through that area, forget it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_59_01">Find Brown&apos;s desk and computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_end_stealth_03">Textbook execution people.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_21_03">That&apos;s an attack helicopter incoming! Hold on to your hats!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_03_02">I like hurting people! Makes me feel like little boy. Or two...</string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_04_03">Why? Why are you doing this? I&apos;ll kill you a hundred different ways!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_71_03">Ahhh, and another vault is ready to be plundered!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_02_01">Why aren&apos;t you at the wine cellar yet, you chops?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_17_any_02">Time to go guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_14_any_03">Those C4 bombs, use the code on them!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_35_03">So, they&apos;re studying one of the boxes in the archaeology lab. Get over there and have a look. And watch out for loose mummies.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_25_01">God damn it, Ale... Bile! How could you miss the roof? Gang, we still need that C4 so you&apos;ll just need to pick it up. Remember, we want the explosives placed around the floors above the panic room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_23_03">I like the sweet sound of that! Now, leave it be for a few seconds and we should be in the clear.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_69_03">They&apos;re trying to shut them down!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_20_01">The local security station, dear friends. That&apos;s your next stop.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_66_03">Only two riding the ziplines at a time, my good friends. And once you&apos;re up, that&apos;s it. So come on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_18_01">Remember - the keycard on the lock there? Not fucking rocket science.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_58_01">You gotta listen to the diagnosis of each patient so you can find out target.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_72_01">Looks like we caught Gensec. Hopefully they&apos;re dropping off. They might have a keycard. Get at them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_56_03">PEOC maintenance, we are currently unable to assist. Please try again later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_10_any_02">Hang tight, too many cops for a pick-up.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_15">Son of a bitch!</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_03_01">A minute.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_03_03">There should be four trucks. See if you can find them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_25_08">Guys, make sure Charon gets to the van!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_06_05">Try to get up to the next floor. </string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_35_03">I hope he doesn&apos;t pass out again at the last moment.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_54_02">OK, well done. We&apos;re back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_65_05">Need you to get to those routers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_13_02">Cops are at the arena. Stay frosty, gang.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_91_04">Load the boxes, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_13_03">Protect that circuit box. The cops&apos;ll try to shut it down. Don&apos;t let &apos;em!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_41_04">Let our friend lead, and keep moving. Carefully.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_09_03b">All right, I&apos;m gonna need my special tools to put the bike together. They should be in their usual place in the workshop inside one of the toolboxes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_04_03">Dallas! Get the cocaine from the van before the cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_31_03">The clock on the wall&apos;s running down fast. Grab the loot and toss it into the vent!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_12a_02">There he is! Ach.. he looks bad, friends. Let him out right away.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_02_08">Bain, I heard nada... This guy in the elevator keep messing it up! Anyway, let&apos;s do it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_gold_a_intro_a_06">I got an inside man who tells me the color of the money on this job is golden.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_cro_03_01">Outstanding marksmanship. Three trucks got it. They&apos;re ready, gang - get out there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_24_01">Okay. Here I am. Now, if you could just affix the straps to the pallet and I can evacuate this beautiful mountain of money.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_29_03">This isn&apos;t the right one!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_58_02">Quickly now, get the compound onto the door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_53_01">The cops have this place surrounded. So you&apos;re going to be going out with the loot. Get in there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_54_02">I just got some intel about another bunch of Sosa thugs arriving at the mansion to reinforce security. The area better be clean, or they&apos;ll be onto you when they arrive.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_02_03">This place is running low on supplies. If you wanna go for more ingredients, signal the chopper with a flare. This pilot&apos;s on the clock, so make it worth while. Or you can bounce. Your call.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_07_03">Saw those transports open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_11_03">The bollards will be controlled remotely. Security office or something. Find it, and get them down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_40_02">The van is just waiting for you to stash that loot. Get busy!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_01_any_04">A boat&apos;s coming in to get Hector&apos;s bags. We need to get &apos;em secured first.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage2_12_any_01">The police have been alerted and are closing in. They&apos;ll be there any second.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_72_05">Cannon still isn&apos;t charging. Start it up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_21_01">Surveillance operator is out of commision. You don&apos;t need to worry about those cameras anymore!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_107_01">Blerrie chops are getting desperate!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_16_01">Now, let it do it&apos;s thing!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_11_03">You gotta restart the saw, friends.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_12_any_03">Get those bags here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_29_01">Now enter the code in the safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_39_02">It&apos;s all gone, gang. No point in hanging around! </string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_08_any_01">It&apos;s alarmed, so don&apos;t open it yet. we need to disable the alarm first.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_18_02">Back in the car! Time to ride!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_54_02">My schematics say it&apos;s on the bottom floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_48_01">We just gave the six o&apos;clock news some great footage! Get the loot in the van.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_08b_any_05">Move! Move!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_intro_01_02">Here it is - the Gensec arena. This Alesso gig is the biggest show it&apos;s seen. Let&apos;s make sure it goes down in history.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_04_05">Try splitting up. One of you might find me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_09_03">I&apos;ll eavesdrop and tell you what&apos;s being said. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_70_03">Still silent. Nice. Find the radio.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_32_01">Jackpot! I&apos;ve got a plan to pry that baby open. I&apos;ll contact Bile right away. He&apos;s going to drop something sweet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_25_any_03">Fuckin feds and their doors. OK, let&apos;s hit that like it is hot. Go!</string>
	 <string id="plt_flt_09_03">All right, that should do it! Coming in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_38_02">This ventilation system could be used to our advantage, you know, to hide a body or transfer some of the extra through.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_02_03">Thats one keycard, we need two - keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_55_03">There, the doors should now be open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_52_03">Looks like the FBI boss is close to your position. Don&apos;t kill him, he might be useful.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_02_03">Hey! Hey, shithead! Three words. Answer. The. Fucking. Intercom.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_49_02">You heard Fedor. Get your asses to the lake.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_19_02">Follow Bain to the canteen!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_16_02">Time to cut out this baby. Place the saws.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_60_02">Get out of there, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_39_01">There&apos;s one more can of thermite in the copy machine. Maybe come back for it?</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_07_01">Hey! Looks like productivity is dropping. Go and give those elves a tongue-fucking they won&apos;t forget! That means shout at them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_56_01">Alright, one more minute til the time lock opens the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_46_03">See, never doubt my plans.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_92_03">If you don&apos;t want to steal more stuff, get onto the helicopter!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_102_01">Just hold your ground until the helicopter arrives!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_05a">Tell me again who Murky have working here?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_02_05">Now you&apos;re going to need...</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_39_02">It&apos;s probably right under your noses, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_03_03">That&apos;s all of them. Get in the car and scoot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_24_03">Hm... That&apos;s sad, but we have not time to lose! Focus on the Commissar now - track him and whack him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_09_01">You know how much that stone is worth? </string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_14_03">Ah, there&apos;s one too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_02_03">Front is secure. Check around the sides and back.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_98_02">Get him the key!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_09_02">Looks like that shape charge got the best of some of the loot. Get the rest!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_50_01">Industrial, high-pressure water pump used by nearby timber mill. If we&apos;re lucky, and the right wagon lands near it, we can use it to fill the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_14_01">... there is no direct way to get past this. We&apos;re gonna need a blowtorch or something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_49_06">You getting those things stowed?</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_05_06">Those nicely wrapped packages of coke are still coming down! Bring as many as you can!</string>
	 <string id="pt1_cs1_01_01">Received, Broadsword. I see the marker. On approach. Over.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_04_02">Take that sniper out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_22_02">You should get in cover for a moment and make sure it&apos;s ok.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_03_01">Did that hurt? I will ask for money back if not.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_17_01">One.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_intro_a_02b">Sneak in, check the cameras to see the Feds working those thankless hours. Get the Mendoza info on the FBI server and get out. Go easy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_35_01">Is that a TV news crew? Try to stay away from them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_04_01">Remember guys, you&apos;re looking for the head of security. We need his USB stick.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_23_03">Don&apos;t forget the store. Drill the door. I bet my cut there&apos;s a goat inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_23_03">Bile will drop off the C4 on the roof of the building. Make sure to pick it up immediately.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_62_01">We got hostiles scaling the wall by the gas station.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_58_03">Make these guys believers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_08_03">Data&apos;s scrambled. Well done. Even if they figure it was deliberate, the results are unusable. Great job.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_57_01">Every 10 minutes, the vault gets a new code. Stick a blocker unit on the keypad to stop it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_11_any_01">OK, we can leave now, but try and take it all if you can.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_19_03">Light another flare to bring the chopper back, gang.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_76_06">They&apos;re going for the weapon!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_05_02">Codelocked door. You&apos;ll have to find the combination somehow.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_13_02">Keycards are gold here. You can use &apos;em to open up areas, close areas down. Use them carefully!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_28_any_01">The process is done! Bag it up, and lets do another round.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_38_any_01">It&apos;s open! Bag the gold!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_09_any_03">OK, that&apos;s a start, we need three more just like it. Get &apos;em! Take them to the van in the parking lot next to the gallery and we&apos;re in business.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_32_02">Just gotta give it some time to fill.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_39_01"> Blerrie! What is that?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_90_02">The van will have trouble getting through if you don&apos;t clear out the area around the bank.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_43_01">OK, focus on the job. There&apos;s evidence scattered throughout the house. Need to take care of it, gotta make sure the FBI loses the scent!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_105_02">The cage is how we get the money out, gang. Get it built.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_23_02">I see the flare. Bravo! On approach. When I am there, would you please attach the pallet to the helicopter. With all haste, I might add,</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_08_03">Damn, where did this door come from? Sorry, gang. I had no information this would be here...</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_24_02">Get the zip-line set up on the roof. Then connect it to the crane.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_09_02">Chopper&apos;s almost ready to pull out. If you want to cash out now, better haul ass, or stay and track down more coke.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_44_01">Uh, Barney&apos;s not available right now. Can I take a message?</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_03_any_01">You can access the hidden cameras in the paintings with the laptop on the roof.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_08_02">The bluechip hired henchmen are here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_17_02">He should be turning red by now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_33_03">I can&apos;t get through this gate. Looks like it&apos;s automatic, so find the control box and run a bypass.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_76_01">Let&apos;s do this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_05_02">That certainly looks like one of the voting machines. When you&apos;re ready to kill democracy, start the hack. Make sure no-one sees you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_15_02">We need to open up the rest of the house. There must be a switch somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_43_02">Nicely done, friends.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_13_03">Fuck! Thought I had it. Didn&apos;t have it. Coming about again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_42_03">Nitrogen must almost be gone by now. Stand by, Bile is on the way with a little present.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_109_02">Crap! Just plant the C4 at the other spot. It&apos;s a sure thing now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_09_02">Come on! Open the gate already and get the stuff we came for.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_06_any_01">Dammit! If you want everything open again, you&apos;re going to need to get into the surveillance room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_01_02">Friends! Beautiful friends! How is the flight? We are getting close to the drop location. So, please, open the hatch and...</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_19_03">Drill the door open and get my cocaine shoe box!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_38_03">You poes need to find a fucking ladder. Fuck me. Come on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_21_02">Great you got the keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_intro_a_01">OK, the airport is just down the hill. Cut through the fence and find the hangar where the truck holding the cases is. The Mendozas will probably be there. Go get those weapons or make sure they don&apos;t. </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_65_01">Good, now to get it powered up. The thing runs on batteries, so have a rummage round and see what you can find.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_40_01">The bird is inbound with the skyhook pieces. Pick-up target is the street. </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_21">...I&apos;m 91% sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_08_03">So guys, where&apos;s that laptop?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_47_03">You&apos;re done, and it&apos;s time to split. Come on, move!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_04_01">Hook up the laptop to the anti-aircraft gun!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_43_02">Take that ladder, my friends. Take it, and profit!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_103_01">Things are getting too hot, I have to pull the chopper out until it calms down.</string>
	 <string id="pt1_fri_08_03">Bombs away! Oh man, that hit hard! Yeah!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_06_02">The van had to leave. He&apos;ll be back, keep your eyes out for the new location.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_86_any_01">Here we go. We should be through in a couple of minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_13_01">Check the camera and see what&apos;s in the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_94_01">Have a look in the cellar yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_44_01">It would be best if these radars were destroyed. Yes?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_26_01">Found a schematic yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_18_01">It&apos;s open! Deal with the deposit boxes, and grab the loot. Four bags is our minimum.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_end_d_01">That was like Baghdad all over again. You need to roll. Hector&apos;s got a line on the Mendozas on their way to the airport. We&apos;re gonna hit their convoy like a ten ton hammer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_14_02">Keep looking for the wagon. Remember, we&apos;re looking for the one with the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_36_02">The manager&apos;s probably crapping his black threads somewhere. Find him. Get his keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_22_01">Move that car so we can get the hell out of here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_28_03">No need to hang around there. Let&apos;s get you home.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_41_01">Bile, you ready to come pick up the cargo?</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_04_to_departure">Step it up! The escape vehicle is leaving in four minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_cnc_02_01">We&apos;ve got an armored transport making an unscheduled stop downtown.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_43_02">No need to keep quiet now. Go fast and hard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_17_03">And there&apos;s the last closet. Deal with the lock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_28_02">Gas has disappeared, get into that vault!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_13_02">Bring the keycard back to the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_06_03">Sealed up, donnerse! OK, there&apos;s a scaffolding outside, use it to get up to the second floor. Find a door to crack open with a saw, to get into the vault room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_28_02">They&apos;re using C4 to blast those doors. Guess they don&apos;t know about all the live ammo that train is carrying.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_02_01">What the hell! A little help!?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_20_02">And... Got it! Well, looks like our Russian friend is somewhere in, hold on...</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_cnc_01">I&apos;ve got a line on a jewelry store that&apos;s just begging to be hit. Call me back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_43_any_01">Alright, the files are all uploaded, it should do the trick.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_46_03">Ok, now you gotta search those bags of coke.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_56_01">Okay, you&apos;re in! My intel says they keep the evidence on the second floor. Go find it!</string>
	 <string id="sys_hb2_03_03">Security door activated. </string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_21_02">There&apos;s a light shining outside the Glitter Room, looks like a monitor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_13_01">Remember, we need six bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_03_02">We&apos;re not going in by the main entrance. You see that fence? That&apos;s our way in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_37_03">...tighten those bolts down friends.</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap04_03">What? Vlad? You filthy Russian! How is your brother-in-law? You know... what&apos;s his name... Hootiejudy.. Houdini?</string>
	 <string id="rb22_bph_intro_02c">Nice, homey place isn&apos;t it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_end_b_01">You did it loud, and you did me proud. Now, let&apos;s see if all that bang-bang was worth it. Half a database is better than none, so let&apos;s see if we have anything.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_52_01">If those lasers are giving you a hard time you can deactivate them with keycards.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_20_03">Time for the main act, getting our friend out. Look for the cell block, it should be nearby.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_15_06">Move the target to the tower!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_03_07">You need to walk through those doors. Chop-chop.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_02_01">Blerrie! Looks like the Feds are here too. Commissioner Garrett must be really, really pissed, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_22_02">And now the vault keypanel! Hustle!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_01a_02">Heh, I wonder if this boat is worth more than what&apos;s hidden on it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_36_06">Maybe if you dog-whistle, Ralph will come out.</string>
	 <string id="pyr_al1_06_04">You guys havin&apos; a circle jerk up there? &apos;cos you&apos;re sure pulling on my shit down here! Get it tight!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_16_01b">I&apos;ll get blasted if I go alone, so you need to take me to the garage. I don&apos;t know about y&apos;all, but I want to get this shit done and over with. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_09_01">Phew, the alarm is disabled. No need to worry about opening doors or windows now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_79_01">Refueling is done, so take that hose off. </string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_15_01">Watch out, Sniper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_31_03">Meeting Rooms are a good bet for finding one of those laptops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_33_03">Power&apos;s back. Now let&apos;s try this once more.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_08_03">Those charges must be hooked up to the four locks. I am sure you don&apos;t need walking through the procedure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_start">Watch out, guys! The cops are surrounding you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_10_01">No need for tip-toeing now. I&apos;m sending the chopper with the drill.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_23_06">Keep looking and you&apos;ll find the armory.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_51_any_04">This upload isn&apos;t going fast enough, dammit!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_22_01">Looks like they&apos;re setting up snipers on nearby rooftops. Keep your eyes open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_25_01">There it goes. The plane is on its way now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_04_05">Go go, find the prison transports.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_14_03">Keep the cops away from the terminal guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_27_01">Good! Ah, not so complicated after all. You should be able to get through by accessing the wire boxes around there and cutting the right cables.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_20_02">What the fu... hey! Are you here to rescue me?!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_34_03">The courier had to throw out the parts, so you will have to go round and find them, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_48_any_03">The pilot is refueling the chopper - he will be back soon I promise.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_10_01">Good, now go get those stones, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_09_01">Woah, some of the loot got caught in that explosion. Lucky for us, there is more in there.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_07_03">Alright, you find me. Great fun, my friends. Now, how about losing me again? </string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_15_01">Hold the cops off until the time lock runs down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_47_any_01">I&apos;m sorry guys, the pilot says he needs to refuel... And it&apos;s gonna take a while. Just hang in there for a while, OK?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_25_any_01">You can use the codes you found to close the window shutters.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_13_02">Gang, the pilot can&apos;t see you. You need to light that flare.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_19_01">Good. Secondly, there is a security room close by. Cut through to it, and approve the airlock sequence.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_63c_01">Quick, type in SYGON.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_46_01">It&apos;s going to blow any second! Duck and cover, friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_17_01">Nice! I&apos;ll detonate these when the time comes. Get back to that storage room. I got it open!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_18_02">Follow Bain through the canteen!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_03_01">Have you found the gate yet, friends?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_110_03">There goes your driver. He&apos;s left a drill behind. Get it, and keep working!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_60_01">That&apos;s no police chopper. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_26_02">Be quick, gang. The guards will notice an open vault door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_01_02">Ok guys, if all goes to plan, we should be able to leave unnoticed. Just slip away with the crowd.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_03_02">Remember to look for the laptop!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_40_01">The cops messed up the time lock! Get it going again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_29_01">Search the other wagons for C4! It should be inside one of the crates.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_12_03">Portable computers... three of them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_17_03">That should do it. Now, let&apos;s find the server room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_12_04">Ach! No, that wasn&apos;t right...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_74_02">Ship security knows nothing. Track down the explosives.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_39_02"> Not just ANY things...</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_50_02">There you go friends, now hurry back in!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_106_03">Found the library yet?</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_21_01">Ah, there he goes. Hahaha, Good.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_62_01">What are you waiting for? Take all of them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_02_any_02">Check your options boys. Going full frontal might sting badly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_161_01">I wanted to ask if you were thinking of trying our All You Can Eat buffet today?</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_10_03">You got to find those shoes!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_01_01">I&apos;m glad you showed up! As you can see, I need some help here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_15_02">Kiff! Now, get into that vault room!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_70_02">Next step is authentication. It will take a while so keep an eye on the timer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_80_06">First World Bank, how can I help you today? </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_09_04">You need caustic soda, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="rb22_bph_intro_02e">Sewers. Why did it have to be sewers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_152_01">Got it. Room...</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_40_any_01">It&apos;s open! Let&apos;s see what we got!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_12_03">Don&apos;t forget the safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_94_01">Fantastic! We got the code for opening the vault. Now, just gotta get inside the security center unnoticed.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_21_05">Find the cell block!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_15_03">That thermite will open the gate for you in no time. Get the briefcase!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_71_04">You&apos;re wasting time friends. </string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_09_03">Too much going on here. The road looks best for the guys to assemble the cage.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_park_suggest_park_02">You should be able to hold your ground inside the park.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_01_01">Just walk straight into the bank.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_49_01">Come on, clowns. Get those bags up to the balcony and into the container. The chopper&apos;s waiting.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_27_any_02">OK, I&apos;m in his system. Lab will open shortly.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_83_01">It&apos;s a nice piece of kit, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_03_01">OK, lets blow this place. C4&apos;s in the limo. Take it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_24_03">Pensacola PD is coming, and it looks like they&apos;ve drafted in every southern ass-kicker too.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_09_01">Come on, show me you can be hackers!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_05_06b">Oh, shit!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_01_03">You know your roles. Walk inside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_58_03">Don&apos;t wait too long friends, just get that mix onto the door, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_24_any_02">Caustic chloride. Says it is some solid form... Wait a... Should be that hydrogen, right? </string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_69_03">I&apos;m guessing any decent IT department will have a spare USB.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_01_01">Remember, we&apos;re here to make it look like a bank robbery. If some election equipment gets destroyed in the process, that&apos;s too bad. And it would be a real shame if the voting results became unusable somehow...</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_60_02">Make sure he&apos;s still breathing!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_138_01">The reception area. Remember the location. Might come in handy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_33_any_01">No bags!? The trade will not be good to us. Hope you guys has some tricks up your sleeve for the trade.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_50_any_01">Pretty soon we&apos;re going to be swamped with news choppers. Our escape chopper? Blend right in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_62_02">Do them one by one, and keep the cops away.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_01_01">My friends! We are approaching the location I have selected for the drop point. So, without further ado...</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_18_01">Bain is heading for the canteen, follow him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_15_02">Job done, guys. Now sneak back to the van and we can consider this one closed.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_07_01">So, guys. You might be wonderin&apos; what happened to our loot. Well, I had to ditch the car but I managed to hide some of it in a storage unit nearby.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_72_02">Both ink and paper roll are in. Now start it up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_08_05">Yes... it&apos;s acid, muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_96_06">Can&apos;t shoot that cannon without more juice, replace the batteries.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_90_03">You need to load both boxes onto the heli before boarding, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_22_03">Alright, here&apos;s an idea. We&apos;re going to make a little call. Get to the telephone outside the house.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_68_02">Got a footman checking out the bank. Make sure he&apos;s... Welcomed.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_02_01">A drunk Santa - it&apos;s a fucking abomination! And my coke!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_50_any_01">Al right, that&apos;s the tiara we&apos;re looking for!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_13_03">That&apos;s the first pallet. All right, good. Now, onto the second.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_07_06">I need covering fire to get the door open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_23_02">Excellent! Now, let it run for a few seconds.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_51_01">Alright, dock&apos;s opened. Now we gotta call the Moretta. Get her moving. Comm frequencies should be on one of the computers in the offices. Find it. I&apos;ll patch in and do the talking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_intro_a_04">Man, I swear I can smell that skel bait from here. We&apos;re at the meth lab. Go in and snag three sacks of the product before the FBI gets here. What Hector wants, Hector gets. For now, anyway.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_26_03">Right friends, that&apos;s who we came for. Do him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_12a_01">That&apos;s the one, right there! Now let him out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_22_01">Time to start looking for that stash of Murkywater contraband. It&apos;s weapons we&apos;re after. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_13_01">Remember, the ladder will let you get up onto the wagons.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_56a_any_02">Got to move!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_09_03">Helicopter will have to bug out for a little while. If you&apos;re ready to go now, be on it. </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_01_05">Locke to Payday Gang, come in. Okay, so, the plane is nearing the drop point! Let&apos;s not dilly-dally here in the dark, let us rise!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_93_02">Don&apos;t keep the chopper waiting, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_04_01">Now use the other keycard in the other control room. Let&apos;s open the gate and get the Moretta out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_30_any_01">Use his computer again, be careful, they only go down for a small amount of time.</string>
	 <string id="plt_as1_intro_01_01">I&apos;m putting you down here. Get ready to clear!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_94_01">Get to the boat!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_brief_01b">Lucky for us, someone in the Mendoza cartel gave up info that they&apos;re being investigated by the FBI. So all we need to do is hit the local FBI office handling the cartel to get the data.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_26_03">Get back to armory and see what you can find!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_96_01">You&apos;ll need to figure out which key is the right one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_36_03">Credit to the Commissar. He hasn&apos;t been cheap with the hatch. The pick-up is pulling strong.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_04_01">Their customer is just around the corner - get ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_cafe_01_to_arrival_subway_01">OK, our contact will be able to open the subway entrance in a minute. Be ready...</string>
	 <string id="pln_wwh_10_01">Damn, get the saw going again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_intro_a_02">The Mendozas are going to be busy loading their guns in the warehouse. Go in and hit &apos;em fast before they go all Lord of War on you. Get those weapons or destroy &apos;em. </string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_113_02">State-of-the-art systems in here friends. Take a closer look at the vault!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_47_02">The chopper&apos;s there, guys. Stow the loot and bug out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_40_02">Great, now unless you wanna stay for more loot, get to the car.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_101_03">Now would be a good time to break out that torch you found before, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_23_01">The door to Garrett&apos;s office is locked, but see if you can bypass it through nearby security boxes. </string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_06_03">There you are, you little fucker!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_10_02">These code breakers can fall over sometimes. Stay with &apos;em till they do their thing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_09_any_01">Get that door open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_71_02">We know that Russian rat is somewhere Downtown. Search for a clue - remember, Downtown.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_06">...I&apos;m blerrie sure. Probably.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_10_03">Bravo! Now, why don&apos;t we get a detonator on there too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_03_03">The one in the white shirt, that&apos;s him, our Taxman. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_42_02">Now let the drill do it&apos;s thing. Keep the cops off it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_brief_02b">Search well and eyes peeled for guards. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_11_01">I think I saw a documentary about that on National Geographic.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_15_05">Like a bull in a china shop!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_13_03">We need to get six bags with us for this one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_19_03">So close to nailing his location. Keep going. Just get him back for a little longer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_06_03">That was easy. Okay, deploy your drill and get that safe open.</string>
	 <string id="plt_pt2_17_02">Okay. Banking for another drop. 30 seconds!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_19_02">Great. Now keep the cops away from it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_30_03">OK, friends. Time to put some fuel in that plane.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58i_01">Move the van out of the way if you need more room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_05_03">Good. Now we can open the trucks up and see what that crazy Ivan was shipping.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_16_03">Go by the fitness center, you should find a computer there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_34_02">Middle and right.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_61_02">The EMP will not only give us a way in, but also knock out the test subjects. Trust me you don&apos;t want to deal with these guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_20_01">We&apos;re going to water crack this vault, guys. Fill it with water, and detonate it. It&apos;ll blow the door right off without damaging the contents.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_03e">Come on already, come on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_14_01">Moretta is moored at Dock 2B. Can&apos;t access it there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_run_05_03">Follow Bile and don&apos;t forget the prisoner!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_10_02">Get that body out of sight.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_59_01">That man there... looks like an IT guy if ever I saw one. Take him to the server room and make him bypass the lock on the security bars.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_150_03">The archives will hold the blueprints. Check the staff areas.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_13_02">Find the security room and grab that footage. Haul ass, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_45_02">Great! Now head to the terrace and place the fireworks.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_10_06">It should be hydrogen chloride instead.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_95_02">How is it going with the car keys?</string>
	 <string id="blm_cs1_01_01">I know what&apos;s going on over there, and I want a slice of the pie. Load a bag with money, and toss it over the yellow wall near Jimbos, the auto-repair shop. Ya hear me? And I see one bag crossing the street, I&apos;ll call the cops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_41_03">Bile, you&apos;re up! How long before you&apos;re here?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_38_03">Put the C4 in the main hall, right above the vault. Two possible spots, so it&apos;s a bit of a lottery. If need be, we&apos;ll blow them both!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_06_any_01">OK, Hector wants us to record this so first set up the camera.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_01_01">Bain, we don&apos;t have all day here. If the snake hides in its hole, we must goad it into sticking its head out. Maybe you should try to destroy some of his precious things.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_91_02">Look for a code that starts with zero.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_09_01">There you go, now find the other one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_99_01">C&apos;mon guys, lets change the change!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_31_01">Nice find. This&apos;ll come in handy later.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_13_01">There you go. Exciting, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_79_03">It&apos;s on the way, any second now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_52_02">So that&apos;s where that Russian rat is holed up. Get yourselves and any loot back to the car. Hmm, those crates got me thinking...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_92_01">OK, friends. Get to the choppa!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_end_loud_01">Things got a little wild, but you got the job done!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_15_03">You need to lure him out. Maybe if you cut the power in the circuit box?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_74_01">Find the guest. Remember, he&apos;s a slot machine addict.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_26_02">Crew, you need to bail. The blue containers will mark the path to the escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_28_02">Burn that trap before you leave! Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_10_01">Dropzone is directly below! Jump now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_22_02">Holy! Was not expecting that. See if she had something for the gate.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_19">He was my chomma. Shit happens though, right?</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_08_03">We&apos;ll move at your pace. Just keep the road clear of cops.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_cbf_01">Dear friends. Commissioner Garrett has arrested the Elephant on trumped-up charges in order to get an item he has, that the owners of Murkywater- these Kataru people, want. He&apos;s making a deal to give it to them in exchange for what we can only guess is the body of Bain, now that they&apos;re done with him. The item obviously very important for them to risk exposing themselves and I wouldn&apos;t bet against the whole thing being about Bain&apos;s Grail-Dinges. We don&apos;t know yet what the Elephant&apos;s doing in all of this, if he&apos;s still solid with us, and we couldn&apos;t help him right now even if we wanted to, but Garrett will be in his FBI headquarters tonight preparing for the exchange, so we&apos;re going to ruin his plans.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_26_01b">We were in this enemy compound in Cambodia and my handler got eaten by a tiger. Dwankie kak he was. My handler, not the tiger.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_68_02">You need to charge the cannon.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_11_01">Friends, you need to restart the saw.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_22_02">Make sure your gang are safely gathered in the airlock. The outer door cannot close until this is so.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_56_03">We are done, my good friends! Everyone into the helicopter!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_34_02">It&apos;s done. The Moretta is on the move! Might take a while, so bunker down. Try not to die.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_14_03">You gotta blow the floor, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_57_02">Hmm, OK... you&apos;re going to have to find the IT guy so he can open them up for you.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_36_any_02">Four left now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_73_03">They&apos;re mining the goddamn parking lot, guys! Be careful out there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_27_03">You see the control room up there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_157_01">The blimp could be all the way across Nevada and would see those.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_04_02">Nice work. The C4 will alert the crowd unless we time it with Alesso&apos;s pyrotechnics. Head upstairs and patch me into the tech booth.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_72_01">Get inside the White House!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_06_02">I can&apos;t open the gate while they are firing at me!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_21">Oh shiiiiiit!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_04_03">Locke sounds a bit...mad. We&apos;d better do what he says.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_15_06">Smash it all up. TV&apos;s. Lamps. Anything that&apos;ll break!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_168_03">Get BFD fixed up, gang. Come on, stop wasting time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_64_01">The thermite&apos;s done. Now jump in and get that cash.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_54_02">OK, friends, it&apos;s time for you to leave. Take some extra loot with you if you can.</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_09_any_01">OK. So listen - our client is a little jumpy. He doesn&apos;t do things involving, you know, lawbreaking otherwise. So we need to have all of you in the train.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_130_02">The White House IT dwankies aren&apos;t as dumb as I thought. There is a firewall blocking me. Touché.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_garage_02_any_01">Move up through the garage, a van is ready to get you out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_83_03">Don&apos;t leave the boxes on the conveyor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_19_01">Good, now hurry up and turn the lights back on or people will go bossies and sound the alarm.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_26_03">You should now be able to see the code. Get it, and go open the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_09_03">Not the right one it seems, you got to keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_01_03">Okay friends, time to crack this nut. Find a way in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_51_02">The artifact is probably behind the door, but we didn&apos;t bring anything big enough to get through. Maybe if you mix some chemicals together... see if you can find any good formulas there. What could happen?</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_28_03">Head back to the vault door and plug in the hard drive. I&apos;ll take care of the rest.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_94_02">There&apos;s one more lock on the door, so you&apos;ll need to re-aim the weapon and shoot it again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_43_02">You will have to protect the device until it blows.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_16_any_01">OK, nearly there now, just grab the server and hustle it to the van. Put your backs into it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_41_01">Nice, you took that sucker out. But hide the mess. The guards will react if they find out you destroyed one of their drones.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_05_01">Blerrie, you&apos;ve got to restart the hack.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_brf_01">I&apos;ve traced the truck to a warehouse out by Goose Island. It&apos;s a distribution depot, contracted to ship the voting machines to their final destination. With a little technical wizardry, we&apos;re going to make those machines a bit more sympathetic to The Elephant&apos;s mayoral candidate - that slimy ballbag McKendrick. Get in there, get them hacked, get out - simple. Once again, The Elephant is extending his stealth bonus if you can keep it quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_06_02">Gold bullion. Probably taken from the enemies of freedom. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_16_03">Alright, that&apos;s his office. Now we move to the next stage.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_02_01">There he is! Wake him up and take him to a safe place. There&apos;s a lumber yard nearby. </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_39_02">Open the gate so you have a clear path to take off.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_45_03">We&apos;ve seen those symbols before</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_16_any_06">Ten seconds and I&apos;m gone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_brief_01b">Little old grandmothers walk right by their blood money every day. Hidden in plain sight, Hector says. At least $100 million in black cash.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_23_01">The armory, friends. Try following the smell of gun oil?</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_03_01b">Don&apos;t say a word. I&apos;m well aware you&apos;re not only here to save my ass. Rust still wants his bike back, right? Well, to do that I&apos;m gonna need all the parts, and they&apos;re spread all over the place.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_89_04">You&apos;ve got to light a flare for Bile to land.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_21_any_01">Alright, do you see the house? Get inside. Look out for guards and cameras.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_28_any_01">Make sure the guards don&apos;t spot us now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_16_02">C&apos;mon friends, get to the West Wing.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_139_01">Disable those AA guns, friends!</string>
	 <string id="mch_pal_intro_02">Clock&apos;s tickin&apos;, asshole. </string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_02_03b">Aw, man... I thought I was toast for sure... Can&apos;t say I expected a group of clowns to suddenly save my ass.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_11_any_04">You want to get out alive? Then move it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_76_01">There&apos;s the alarm and... Damn! Everything shut down. OK, forget the keycards. We&apos;re blowing the gate. I told you I had a plan B. Bile will drop the C4 charges for you, just light a flare to signal him where you want the C4 bag to be dropped.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_park_escape_location_01">The van should arrive on a street near the park.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_19_02">Let&apos;s go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_08_04">You got what he asked for, now you need to bring it to him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_07_03">Stay alert. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_118_02">A laser gate! That was unexpected. Touching that will set off their alarm. Watch the cycle, wait for it to blink off, and then run through.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_17_02">Don&apos;t stand there waiting, follow him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_13_01">OK, I&apos;m receiving the second half of the database. With a complete download, we stand a solid chance of locating the truck carrying the machines.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_71_02">We gotta do this the loud way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_151_02">Come on, guys. Get the plans scanned and faxed. Do it in IT.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_12_03">We have enough diesel now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_33_any_01">Oh no, that&apos;s the alarm! Lets go to plan B.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_08_any_03">Check the roof - find your route inside. Get creative, we don&apos;t have time.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_03_03">OK, we need reach international waters with ship, but must have more diesel fuel.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_25_02">Outside the Velvet Room, I see a lit display screen. Go have a look.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_12_01">...Find the computer lab, hack into a terminal and search for the box&apos;s location.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_99_01">Ah crap! More lasers. Must be an independent system. Watch the pattern. Don&apos;t want to trigger any alarms now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_69_01">The kerels stamped the fire out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_11_02">The inner sanctum is probably accessed by a reinforced door or something. See what you can find.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_08_02">Get to hacking that laptop, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_04_any_01">We&apos;re looking for the agreed amount of jewels from the store... If you want more, go back and get &apos;em.  </string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_04_04">Vlad wants to speak with you...</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_13_02">Ride through the gate and you&apos;ll be safe!</string>
	 <string id="crn_man_01_03">Like a glooove!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_07_02">I got the manager&apos;s file here. Looks like the guy was born to wear this black suit.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_11_01">The safe&apos;s open. Let&apos;s see what&apos;s in it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_47_01">Red Squares!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_29_any_03">Damn it! They locked you in. Main entrance is the only option now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_intro_01">Get ready friends, we&apos;re almost at the target site.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_50_02">Let the Inside Man know when you&apos;re ready to de-mask. He&apos;ll move the loot, so be sure you secured what you want inside the vent.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_103_02">Move it, guys. Find the locker room, and we find the armory.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_100_01">Keep the Murkys away from the drill, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_13_02">Find that shelf yet, friends? Get to the computer lab.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_36_01">...bring all the winch parts into the vault room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_70_03">What the hell! Cops just breached another way in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_43_01">You need to get the bags to the platform where you came in. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_26_01">Halfway there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_115_03">Hey, Ralph is still there. Be ready to grab him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_23_02">The power has been cut! You have to get the juice flowing again, then restart the crane.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_02_03">...Kerels right around the corner, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_19_01">Ok, I got the doors. But they won&apos;t open until the ECM jammer stops.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_40j_02">Can&apos;t cut that gate without a proper welding torch, friends. That&apos;s &apos;blowtorch&apos; for you Yanks.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_88_02">You should know this by now. Drills don&apos;t start themselves. </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_11_02">Alright you chops, go and find his office!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_63_02">Ach, that door&apos;s going to take a bit to crack. Maybe that cannon-dinges will do it. See if you can get it aimed.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_11_04">The saw isn&apos;t working, you need to get it going again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_09_03">That&apos;s how much we need. You guys can stay and get more if you feel like you are on a roll!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_105_05">You need to get that bypass going again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_12_any_01">Two more, keep on searching.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_49_02">You need to get to the secure area. Open up one of those gates.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_33_03">You gotta get some more gas in that donnerse pump.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_04_01">The fuck took so long, man?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_11_01">Do the words &quot;rig the detonator to the charges&quot; ring a bell?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_83_01">The code should have a two at the beginning.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_20_03">The plane, friends, the plane!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_13_01">Guys, the safe! Get the drill on it - pronto!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_31_01">Time for a short breather. Wouldn&apos;t do us good if I collapsed with Bain.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_06_01">Escort whoever is carrying that server. It&apos;s gonna be heavy, and I think the cops will try to liberate it from you.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_05b_any_04">... just hang on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_05_02">...hydrogen chloride?</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_08">I hope this hunk o&apos; metal has air bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_34_01">Well, so much for stealth. But the job&apos;s half done. Just get that money out of there.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_07_07b">Hey! Protect me!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_42_02">You need to get it armed.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_16_02">The manager might have forgotten to put his cup in the dishwasher and left it out...</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_123_02">Ach, the dinges is trying to update the operating system. Stop it at the mainframe!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58e_03">That turret is major trouble. You&apos;ll have to find a way to take it out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_11_01">Well done, now get in there and see if you can use the security cameras to find Bain.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_85_02">One time, I was in the jungle with a kak piece of laptop, trying to hack into this ancient security system being run by a bunch of dwankie terrorists. In a very unfortunate event, a snake bites my leg, and I mistakenly activate the alarm, alerting everyone, and making them blow up the entire place. Lots of terrorists died, and no one got paid that day. Blerrie snake...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_12_02">Great! You can use this ladder to get up on the wagons.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_94_03">You need to shoot the weapon again, this time aimed at the second lock.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_81_02">Have a look around and and see if you can find a utility closet. Maybe there will be some useful tools.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_58_01">The code you have has been disabled, but I think the system has a master code. Let me do some digging.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_24_03">Ok. I can override the main panel now.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_09_any_01">Stay alive till I get back for more.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_23">This has to be the most persistent fucking cops I&apos;ve ever seen!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_31_02">The Dentist&apos;s intel says they have C4. There&apos;s an armory near the guards&apos; locker room. Get there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_31_02">Ah! The first bag! You will find a vertical conveyance near the vaults that will relay the loot up to me. It will be perfectly safe! </string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_10_02">Alright, the cops are on the way. This caper is less Pink Panther, and more Reservoir Dogs. Get to the security room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_31_03">Give me a moment to catch my breath.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_55_01">&quot;Brown&quot; is the desk name you should be looking for.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_40_03">Now, let&apos;s mount the drill on the gates.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_17_01">This is where you boosted the samurai armor. Remember?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_22_03">Gang, into the dealership. Take cover. I&apos;m blasting the road.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_10_02">No time to waste, get through those bars asap.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_12_03b">Hey, hold your horses. Take this blowtorch. You&apos;re gonna need it to get inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_47_01">Damn, looks like the EMP isn&apos;t in this train car. There could still be some valuable loot here, so either grab it now or come back for it later. Your choice.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_brief_01">The Elephant gave us the locations of the biker gang hunting for the scientist&apos;s little device. I think they&apos;re close to finding him - we need their intel so we can get to him first.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_90_01">Secure the boxes on the helicopter.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_07_02">They built it on the bottom floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_10_02">A vault! The Commissar is pulling every string to keep his ass alive. I&apos;m sending over a thermal drill.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_02_09">Blerrie, if I read this correctly... eh...</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_15_01">Get him to the tower!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_26">The police are on our back like a fucking pony tail!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_03">These guys can drive!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_13_03">You need to find out who has that keycard, friends. It&apos;s probably written somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_17_06">Come on friends, you really must get that door open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_09_02">...Hack into a mainframe computer terminal and try to find some clue where to begin searching, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_01_02">Remember, you in civvie mode. That means no guns or masks. You&apos;re invisibles. Micho, our Inside Man here, left a guitar case with your gear somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_102_06">Look at the formula, then prepare the next component.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_140_01">This is the reception desk.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_47_01">And... we go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_19_03">If I were them, I&apos;d keep the keycard in a safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_41_any_02">Sorry guys, he says this ain&apos;t the one. The chopper will be back in a few so you can get another one over here, hopefully the right one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_74_02">You gotta get some fuel in that dinges. Get to work. </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_04">...I think so, at least.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_50_02">Now if that won&apos;t get people talking, I don&apos;t know what will. That was amazing, gang, and we&apos;re getting a juicy payday out of it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_13_01">Now you gotta blow a nice little hole to get into the vault room, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_05_03">That was intense! All right, head back to the vault and let&apos;s finish the job. </string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_gold_stage1_intro_a_01">Recon the bank. My guy dropped a thermal drill somewhere on the premises, around the back of the bank, find it. Then get in there and do your thing to the vault. Gold awaits.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_52_03">Get at the vault, you&apos;ll need to get past security.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_54_01">See if there&apos;s a hidden switch or something. My old gaffer used to hide things in his bookshelves...</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_89_02">That should be all the clues. You should be able to figure out how to open it up now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_16_02">Maybe get rid of that tarp, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_depositbox_stage1_intro_a_02b">I advise caution - this bank has a lot of traffic. Empty all those safe deposit boxes and make us all happy.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_06_01b">Hey! Don&apos;t leave me!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_133_01">Nine</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_69_01">Don&apos;t think anyone knows you&apos;re there. Now get the comm frequency.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_06_02b">What the hell! Don&apos;t run away from me!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_86_03">You&apos;re not going anywhere until you restart that saw.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_38_03">Wouldn&apos;t surprise me if Garrett, trying to be clever, put it somewhere stupidly obvious.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_34_any_01">See if you can find the keycards to  get in there, otherwise we have to drill the doors.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_48_02">You&apos;re ride&apos;s here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_110_01">The party seems to have stopped. People are leaving!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_118_01">Hang on guys. Coming in. ETA 3 minutes</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_04">They&apos;re on to us like a fucking sticker!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_17_02">Chopper will be at the antenna. Wait for it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_37_02">Let the drill do it&apos;s job. You do yours.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_01_01">Close, but no cigar, assholes!</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_28_02">Don&apos;t insult my wheels, man!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_72_01">Reboot the charge cycle.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_02_01">Why, you snivelling shopa! For this, I will scoop out your eyes and feed your bones to my dogs.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_19_03">Get the power back up before the civvies get paranoid and the alarm goes off.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_07_01">Fucking cops! </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_38_03">And... Jackpot! Moretta specs including comm frequencies. Great work! Now look for the nearest radio, and let&apos;s talk to the Captain.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_17_02">The chopper is on standby. Call it when you want but be warned - soon as it appears things are gonna go loud. Choose your moment.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_53_02">Make sure you look around everywhere.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_16_03">See if you can find a cup with prints.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_30_03">That&apos;s not a bad idea! Would be extra humiliating to the cartel, for sure!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_intro_02_01">Let&apos;s rock!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_16_02">You still gotta cut the power.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_24_01">Gage has arranged for one of the dumpsters to be used to stash some loot. </string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_64_05">Make a little bonfire here on the floor!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_09_06">It&apos;s caustic soda.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_03_05">I really need you to hack me into those security boxes ASAP.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_47_03">Still have one more box to go. Go back to the mainframe and look for it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_08_02">Okay, you need to clear the joint from the remaining thugs. Find them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_54_03">Still looks stable, friends. Time to add the last ingredient.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_29_03">Not going up this way. Look around. Has to be another path.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_80_01">You have to get the garage doors open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_07_01">Connecting. We can only do them one at a time, so fingers crossed this is the right one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_intro_a_03">This is our last chance to help The Elephant get his man to office. So get to work, gang.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_35_01">You can probably find fuel in one of the warehouses. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_11_01">OK. Second act in our little drama - get the vault open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_05_02">Grab the thermite. No time to drill so we&apos;re burning through the wagon itself.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_04_06">Find the manager. Look for the creepy guy in a suit. 40&apos;s. Going bald. That&apos;ll be him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_100_04">The right key has got to be there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_04b_03">Chop chop friends. Find that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_117_01">Find The Dentist&apos;s loot, guys! </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_73_01">The Vault is fully locked down.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_77_03">The hacking was stopped! Go restart it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_10_03">That&apos;s it, router boxes taken care of. </string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_06_03">Fuck it, you&apos;re here ain&apos;t you?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_51_01">Friends, it&apos;s time to get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_77_01">You&apos;re going to have to crack open this crate too.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_43_02">If you can patch me into the mainframe, maybe I can get us in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_97_01">Try another key!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_76_02">I think that rug was quickly thrown down, probably hiding a hatch. We&apos;ll check it out later.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_50_03">Get going to the bio-lab.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_90_01">What are you doing? Secure the artifact!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_85_02">They got to the control box and stopped the shutdown. You need to get it going again, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_101_02">Cut through there with that nice blowtorch you found!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_26_01">Get to the control room - the black heart of the facility. From there, you can open the vaults and grab all that, as you say, &apos;good shit&apos;.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_96_02">Security chief&apos;s code. His ass is in trouble for leaving this around.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_07">Hold on for dear life!</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_04_02">The Murkywater trains will be locked by some kind of security panel. We&apos;ll most likely have to hack them to get the doors open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_53_03">Nothing left to do but make like tree...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_26_02">Hi, this is Special Agent, uh, Smith. Can you tell me the panic room code? Our terminals are down. Can&apos;t get today&apos;s code.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_03b_any_04">... stay frosty!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_snipers_nearby_02">Keep your heads down! They&apos;ve got snipers in the area!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_08_01">Now, get in there and see what you can find.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_28_01">Hey! I&apos;m not leaving without MY car!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_14_01">Alright, that&apos;ll keep Gage sweet. You guys can cash this out now, or stay for more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_162_03">I just wanted to make sure that you know that our All You Can Eat buffet is now available.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_brf_02">The Elephant&apos;s PR will claim he came to power through depth, leadership and integrity, but that&apos;s bullshit. That oily bastard&apos;s going to cheat his way to the Senate, and this is where you come in. There are trucks at Pier 39. One of them has voting machines. Find the truck and attach a GPS-tracker to it. We&apos;ll deal with it down the line. Naturally, The Elephant wants this done with as little chance of bad press coming back to him as possible. So he&apos;s ear-marked some of his considerable campaign funds for a special black-ops bonus. You guys do this quietly, and the good politician will see you well rewarded.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_18_02">There was mention of a shrine being of importance.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_20_02">There we go. It&apos;s ringing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_01_02">Everyone OK? Then move out! You gotta find the crash site and that drunken pilot - unless he&apos;s wrapped his neck around a tree. We&apos;ll sort out an evac once you get him someplace safe.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_26_03">Seeing a lot of SWAT vans rolling in. Those kaks can bring this chopper down. I can&apos;t pick you up here. But I have a plan...</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_13_03">Now we need remove mooring ropes from dock!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_110_01">If you use ziplines, you can speed it up a bit, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_13_02">Now, what will we find?</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_18_03">You see that marked door? That&apos;s one of our closets.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_02_03">Ach! If the kerels are here too, Garrett must be stepping up his game in helping Murky, to go all the way out here. Or he&apos;s just very pissed with us.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_71_01">Time to go to plan B!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_11_02">Not a lot of time here friends, get that unit open!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_67_01">Time to charge it. There should be a control panel around there, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_67_04">The power is down! Blerrie kerels! Turn it back on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_22a_03">You know, the thing you&apos;re looking for might be in a bookshelf.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_122_03">Hurry now, reconnect me to the grid.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_04a_any_03">Arriving in three minutes...</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_55_01"> Server room, yeah? Maybe if you find the person in charge of it, you can get him to bypass the lock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_64_01">They&apos;re trying to flank you at the parking lot. </string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_19_01">... by the looks of it, these bars are pretty thick. We&apos;re going to need something to help get through.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_40_02">Hey, there he is. Looks like he&apos;s in the garden area.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_30_03">I know there&apos;s C4 in one of the wagons. Check &apos;em out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_16">That was our chaplain. You guys are stone cold.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_02_03">I would&apos;ve thought you had gotten to the wine cellar by now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_02_02">Get out of the crates. Hit &apos;em with surprise.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_07_03">Ain&apos;t never seen a job this screwed.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_30_02">Stop loitering and get over to the vault!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_136_03">It&apos;s tacky, but it&apos;s fun, and knows it. Welcome to Vegas, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_06_01">OK, time locks are history. Now, get down there and get that final door open!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_15">They&apos;re on us like fucking flies on a turd!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_05_04">Restart the bypass on those security boxes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_19_01">Use the kitchen blender to make an evidence cocktail.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_11_03">You&apos;re all down, yes? No broken ankles? Good. Now find the first money pallet. They&apos;re there somewhere. Find em, and light a flare. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_18_03">I guess they know we&apos;re not selling Girl Scout cookies. Grab the C4 and blast your way in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_55_08">You looking to rent an office? What&apos;s the delay?</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_01_02">It&apos;s a beautiful building, but we&apos;re bringing ugly business. We&apos;ll need codes to get deeper in, so look for their servers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_12_04">You gotta remove that saw, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_32_02">Maybe there&apos;s something historical to the code?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_42_03">Looks just like the one you did a while back in California, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_cnc_03">I need you to deliver a message to the Sosa Cartel. A message written in blood.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_23_01">Get back to the security gate and use the thermite.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_98_03">Look out, friends! The laser system has gone off. You&apos;ll need to shut it down somehow.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_02a">Well, you have to get the oil temperature just right.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_24_01">That&apos;s it, buddy. Drink up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_17_05">And another...</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_04_02">There you go, friends. Metal detectors are down.</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_16_any_01">Great, we got it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_02_03">There&apos;s a laptop with info on where the cash is stashed. Charon provided the password. See if you can find it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_31_02">I think I see a PC in one of the meeting rooms through the secruty camera. </string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_04_07">I have more guns than the Army. You wait and see. </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_07_01">You&apos;ve got to find a way past the gates.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_88_03">Get the drill going again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_26_02">That&apos;s it, gang. That should take care of the gas in the scanning room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_14_03">Fires are out. Nicely handled.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_09_01">Hey, thanks for the rescue guys. Best of luck to ya.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_66_02">Ok, now you gotta get inside the office and get the code. Move over there fast, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_15_03">Get the prisoner to the tower!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_14_any_02">Alright, two!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_65_01">Well, fuck me, that was a waste of time. The vault is empty. Find the good ones, you hear?!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_07_02">I got the first half of the database. It may be enough, maybe not, so it&apos;s your call - get out of there now, or stay and get the second half.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_27_any_01">Open up that last door and get to the server.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_39_03">Look at all this timber. There&apos;s got to be a saw somewhere - keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_02_to_departure">The escape vehicle is leaving in two minutes, with or without you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_23_03">Nicely done, friends. Now follow Bain up to the roof!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_28_02">Pilot just landed the passenger. You can go home!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_20_02">The door needs approval, remember. Hurry. Stop playing with your dicks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_76_01">He&apos;s lying through his teeth. Get him to the chopper, I&apos;ll get the code out of him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_28_02">Downloading the pyro schedule. You hit the button I say, got it?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_102_02">Ach, you got the code wrong, you chops! It&apos;s gonna take some time before it resets.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_06_03">The Inside Man has marked a ceiling vent for you to secure the loot at.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_68_01">Kaboom, good work! Keep it up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_08_02">All projects run here are temporary, so a lot has changed.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_81_02">Secure the loot.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_26_02">Now. Overlooking this area you will find the control room. From there the vaults in this part of the facility are controlled. That would be useful, yes?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_18_03">Ok, let&apos;s see... hmm... we need a plan for this...</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_38_03">...You gotta get that hook onto the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_60_03">Hurry up you chops! Find the IT guy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_45_01">Good - the seal is history. Now keep watching that drill. If it jams, you need to restart it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_80_02">The aim was a little off, but not too bad.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_14_any_05">Don&apos;t screw around in there - get it done!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_brief_01c">And yes I know. Out of the frying pan, into the fire...</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_32_03">Keep those dwankies away!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_84_02">Blerrie! Those guns will make short work of Bile if he tries to land now. You need to take them out by hacking he control boxes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_37_03">We&apos;re going to use the bank roof as the pick-up for the cage. Over.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_20_01">Time to get our friend out. Find the door to the custody cell block, it should be near.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_42_02">Assemble the winch in the main hall, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_28_01">Get ready. Bile&apos;s almost back. Connect the hose!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_15_any_01">Three bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_05_01">OK, let&apos;s try this. Find something connected to the dock&apos;s network. I should be able to pull up their shipping manifests. Might have some clue about where they&apos;re headed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_108_01">Halfway there. Find the other card, and swipe it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_118_01">Whatever it is, we got it! Get it to the limo.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_51_02">Ach, the keypad doesn&apos;t work. You gotta blow the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_112_02">Those Murkys will be rather angry when you return, but we&apos;ll deal with that later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_139_01">This area&apos;s employees only. All the offices are accessible from here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_11_any_01">Nicely done, now cut the other one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_31_04">Are you in the garage yet?</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_22_08b">Don&apos;t let &apos;em come this fucking close to me!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_08">Ahhh, he was my friend. Well, what can you do?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_68_01">Take it and find the evidence lockup. Maybe we can get in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_05_02">There we go! Vault is open. Get to work on bagging that cash! </string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_04_01">They&apos;ve seen you! The trucks are moving out. Alright, we need a Plan B. Lemme think.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_46_01">Try another one. See if you get it right this time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_intro_05">OK, time for a jewelry hit. We need at least six bags. That could prove a challenge - but you guys can do it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_36_06">Still need the keycard off the manager, gang. Find him, deal with him!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_47_any_11">At least 15 more!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_17_any_01">Jackpot... Look at all the cash... Get it out now!</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_14_03">All mooring ropes must be taken off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_13_01">You can secure the loot bags in the boat you came in on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_16_01">Are you in the West Wing yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_09_02">We managed to bribe Buluc&apos;s old girlfriend for some info, and she mentioned this door. You will find how to open it deeper in the mansion, inside something Buluc calls his &quot;inner sanctum&quot;. Find that place.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_20_02">The Glitter Room might be worth checking for a laptop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_19_02">Hmm, explosives won&apos;t work, it&apos;s too dangerous... let me see...</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_03_12">Mrs Shevchenko would roll in her grave to see her little boy now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_55_04">What are you waiting for?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_04b_any_01">... closing in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_26_any_01">My recommendation is you hustle those bags to the van.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_37_03">That vault needs to be cracked open for us to get the artifact. Stick a drill on it, friends.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_19_09">Unwise move, very unwise!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_37_02">Bliksem! Don&apos;t disturb those lasers! Can&apos;t find anything in the blueprints about them. Probably added later. That kind of system can usually be disabled via the roof.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_11_02">Guys, we still need a keycard.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_07b_any_05">... super close!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_44_any_01">Alright, bring it to the van, it&apos;s right across the street.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_46_any_01">They&apos;re gonna try to kill the power! Don&apos;t let them!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_07b_any_02">... don&apos;t let me wait now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_44_01">We&apos;re still running low on spending money, so if you find anything else worth taking...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_35_01">That&apos;s all the numbers needed for the armory. Go enter that code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_119_03">Roberts Bank values every chance to communicate with our customers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_103_04">Have you got the ark open, yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_123_02">The frequency ain&apos;t here. The control room is across the dock - maybe check there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_05_05">Damn chops have killed the bypass, get it going again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_45_03">We could&apos;ve used that guy on the retinal scanner. Nevermind. It&apos;s Plan B time.</string>
	 <string id="bkm_cs1_01_02">Yes ma&apos;am, we offer international wire transfers at a reasonable rate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_24_02">What the hell! The whole room is filled with gas. Quickly! Find out where it&apos;s coming from and find a way to shut it off!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_53_02">Rather beautiful, yeah? Old writing and all, just like the stuff that sent us here. Whatever it is.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_16_03">Blerrie, are you still standing around?</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_24_02b">That&apos;s it ladies and gentlemen. IT. IS. DONE. Now, I need to get the fuck outta here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_46_02">Hurry friends, get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_08_04">I fuckin&apos; hate hospitals, man. I ever turn into a vegetable, you guys end my ass. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_03_03">You still gotta have a look at the security gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_brf_01_01">Teuer autos is our objective here. We&apos;re going to hit their dealership late in the evening. Should be quiet, not many civilians. They&apos;re a high-end joint. Deal in importing high-performance supercars from Europe and Japan. Those cars are a work of engineering beauty. And they&apos;re expensive - we&apos;re talking the price of a house in Georgetown here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_93_05">Get onboard friends. Bile has to leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_22_03">Jesus, that bastard wasn&apos;t playing around, was she? Take the keycard she dropped.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_02_01">...Kerels will be there any second.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_50_01">Good, now get back in there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_22_01">Make sure all you fine people are inside, the outer door must close before the inner door can open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_89_03">Have a look around for anything useful while I see what we can do about this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_01_03">Okay, the convoy is close. Get in position.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_35_01">Head to the archaeology wing. There should be an artifact somewhere in there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_124_01">Ach, now we gotta wait for the dinges to finish!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_27_02">Just one more.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_intro_01_03">Why does that not fill my head with confidence? If you&apos;re going to stay, then sit back and be quiet.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_13_04">See if you can find the evidence. It should be here somewhere!</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_07b_01">It&apos;s by the warehouse across the street. Gonna need a saw to open it though &apos;cause I lost the key in the commotion. There&apos;s one in the back.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_intro_01_00a">Right you chops. Lets get you-</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_67_01">Not much time. F35s deployed to patrol D.C. airspace. We&apos;re gonners for sure if you don&apos;t hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_48_01">One of &apos;em contains the vault. Find it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_33_01">Ach, it looks like they are raising the security a bit. Be ready to encounter more Murkys, for sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_128_01">Four</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_15_03">Cops screwed the hack. Reboot it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_82_02">Open sesame! Now go find that prisoner!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_27_any_01">Van&apos;s here, folks.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_35_04">OK, let&apos;s get Bain into that helicopter so we can leave this place!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_50_01">You need to patch me in so I can open those doors.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_78_03">It&apos;s like a never-ending number of screws, yeah? But you got to get them all off.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_15_01">Look for a coffee cup. All managers drink coffee. So I&apos;ve heard.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_85_01">The kerels stopped the saw. Get it going again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_18_any_01">No gold... No cash... Crack the deposit boxes. Hope you brought a saw.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_58_04">Make them earn their tom tonight, yeah? For sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_71_01">Good job, gang. Get up the ladder and get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_82_01">Zero</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_60_03">Who&apos;s flying that chopper. Not the cops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_153_01">Its vent connects with the Security Center.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_29_03">Run! Run!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_63_01">Nice night for a barbacao. Shame the Cartel dwankies know we&apos;re crashing it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_79_07">Soviet era machinery. Slow. So slow.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_intro_03">Don&apos;t stop too long, friends. This is bat country!</string>
	 <string id="geo_glc_06_01">Alright, got the package. Heading home.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_01_02">We&apos;re here. Nice night for a murder.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_53_01">I&apos;ve been able to find out that the routine for opening the door to Buluc&apos;s office is kept in his secret meeting room. See if you can access it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_38_03">That shrine is concealing a door. We&apos;re going to use explosive on it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_05_01">Good. Ah, fresh air! Now, the pallets are secured to the deck by mechanical fasteners. These fasteners are controlled by the logistics officer, and his controls are... ah, up there. And the access to the upper deck is at the front of the plane. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_07_01">OK, chopper&apos;s here. Secure any loot you found. You can bail when you feel like it, but I&apos;m sure there&apos;s always more loot out there. Your call.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_33_03">At the back you can throw any bodies over the railing into the sea.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_66_02">Still don&apos;t know you&apos;re there. Look for the keycard.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_58_05">Do it like you did it at the warehouse. Yeah, I saw that. For sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_92_01">Repeat, the code is...</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_59_02">You should make an effort to move the van.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_55_02">The symbols in that codex! They will open the Mayan dinges. There must be more clues. Find them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_33_01">You can throw bodies into the sea over the railing at the back of the boat.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_06_01">You need to disable the metal detectors. Cutting their power will do the job. Look for electricity boxes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fourstores_stage1_end_b_06">We got a lot of heat for a small take, but worth it to get Vlad happy. It&apos;ll probably pay off long term.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_43_03">One less prize for Murky to keep. Pick it up and move on, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_01_any_03">Ready for the shot? OK listen: you are looking for the paintings marked with red stickers. They&apos;ve got unusually tight security here. A lot of cameras, even a security room, so do your homework.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_71_05">Keep a watch on that sprinkler system!</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_11_01">Yeah, tell him his ass is on the line if he isn&apos;t available for the regular time-lock check in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_42_03">The data is being stored on the server in the other room. You can get it and get the hell outta here, or you can stay and scan more bodies. I&apos;m positive Jimmy will make it worth your while.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_11_03">Great. All the safes are in. Now let&apos;s see the truck back at the yard, gang - hustle!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_39_02">You have to restart the drill!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_96_03">Old Locke is glad he&apos;s not creeping around that place with you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_13_01">SWAT van on the way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_125_03">Domkop government PCs...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_112_01">Don&apos;t forget the bags.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_48a_03">We got through the first level. Start up the second.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_38_04">You got to drill a big hole in that vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_42_01">While you&apos;re waiting on that vault door, might as well have a go at those safe deposit boxes. They&apos;re Titans, so you will not be able to just cut through.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_73_02">Kerels have pulled the emergency power cutoff lever. Find and reset it, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_17_01">That looks right, now lift the print!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_74_03">You&apos;ll find it on the bottom floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_58_03">The lobby&apos;s too hot! Get upstairs!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_107_02">Head to the armory and load up on C4.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_42_02">Hector!? What the hell!? I always though the Firestarter job felt a bit weird. The Mendoza&apos;s, maybe they weren&apos;t the bad guys after all. I mean, sure, they were rotten apples, but this fucking rat was far worse.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_100_03">Now would be a good time to break out that torch you found before, friends.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_11_05">Fuck man, I got Brown&apos;s brains all over me!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_87_01">Who&apos;s that ugly kakspul?... What the blerrie... is that...!? Ach! No time to deal with that now! Get out of there! Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_14_02">Looks like there might be an underground vault somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_89_01">Okay, the briefcases. First is held by casino manager, the second one by the pit boss and the third by their head of security.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_06_02">Alright, now hook that hose to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_11_03">Ok, got the switchboards fixed. You can start the computer again.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_06">These are some determined fucking law enforcers!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_18_03">They&apos;ve cut the power on you, friends. Find the circuit box and get it running again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_33_02">Have a look around and and see if you can find a utility closet. Maybe there will be some useful tools.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_32_01">We still need more explosives on the fourth and fifth floor. Let&apos;s go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_38_01">Drill through that vault, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_99_03">Have you not been able shut down the sytem yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fourstores_stage1_intro_a_02">Go for cash registers, display cases, the occasional safe. Get enough money to satisfy Vlad and clear out. Don&apos;t hang around. It&apos;s an easy gig. </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_44_01">Another successful acquisition! Well done, my friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_04_03">Get the USB stick from the head of security.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_13_03b">We cannot use the main entrance. Too much heat.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_49_03">If you patch me into the security boxes to the storage room, I can unlock the doors to it.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_18_02b">Okay, I got what I came for! Get me back to the truck so I can put the shit together.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_03_03">...muriatic acid?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_103_01">Keep it cool. Keep it under control, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_07_03">Chopper is here. Stow any bags. You can ride out now, or you can stay and find more coke. Your decision.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_65_02">That was a great show, gang! Watching those accounts rise, and their shares topple. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_06_03">Left gate activated. Now find another keycard, and let&apos;s get the other gate open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_70_01">Get that fire going again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_85_02">You gotta start the drill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_91_03">First digit for the vault code. Keep searching. We need all three.</string>
	 <string id="csf_cs1_03_01">Hi. I just saw a show, and the bank got robbed, and I want to move my money to a bank that doesn&apos;t get robbed.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_54b_any_01">... the head honcho loves detail-oriented motherfuckers!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_03_03">Crack open that door with a saw, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_can_01_03">You need to eliminate those thugs.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_snipers_nearby_01">Stay low! Snipers took out your driver! They must be deployed near by.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_19_03">Nice, nice. Now spark a flare close by. Show me where I&apos;m flying.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_26_03">Time to pick up the C4 and then plant it on the floors above the panic room.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_29_03">Ahhh, if any sound is sweeter than that of an opening vault it is that of bagging loot. You are producing a symphony for my ears!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_46_03">Ah! Get inside that vault, friends! Almost done here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_end_a_01">Wow. This would make a great tv movie. For someone who isn&apos;t you. Anyway now we know where the Mendoza bank is located. </string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_52_any_02">You still got a long way to go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_30_any_01">Getting pretty unpleasant out there. You guys sure you wanna stick around?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_22_02">If you did it right, it will now cook!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_54_02">Looks like a last desperate attempt to clip our wings, hey? Stand firm, brave warriors.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_01_01">My new friends! Welcome to Black Ridge. Like a storehouse for loot - an armored storehouse, with very valuable loot.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_36_03">Vlad, stop kicking my blerrie chair. You&apos;re not helping.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_tap01_01">Give me a few moments and I&apos;ll tap into the feeds.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_18_03">That alarm needs to go quiet. Find the switch for it around there, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_11_01">Look around for entry ways that seem to stand out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_02_02">Right, let&apos;s try and get this security shut down. You need to find the circuit boxes that power the system. Get hooked in to them. I can hack them to power down the system without tripping their wires.</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_09_03">That&apos;s it. I have to send a team over and notify the police.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_08_02">Can&apos;t unlock the doors until you patch in properly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_13_01">That was harder than expected but we&apos;re go! You can enter the house now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_cash_cnc_06">I&apos;d feel bad about hitting another bank if they felt bad about hitting us. So I don&apos;t. Let&apos;s cash out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_07_03">Green and sweet! Bag that cash!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_69_02">Have you found the computer yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_39_03">One of the pallets is on the roof of the diner. What would those burger-flippers do to have that kind of cash, eh? </string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_69_03">They put the fire out with their feet!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_66_02">Found any power cells?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_17_03">Now get inside the Oval Office and find the keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_44_01">I&apos;ve rigged the bus to... Well, just give the signal. And stand back.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_94_02">It&apos;s always lovely watching thermite work! Now get inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_11_02">You can only melt through that wagon with the thermite, so you better head back and fetch it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_48_01">Get back to the mainframe.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_03b">Is it inappropriate of me to think this might be kind of fun?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_12_02">Time to find Garrett&apos;s office, friends. Have a little fun with the guy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_19_03">There&apos;s an offer on the table. Not enough in Locke&apos;s humble opinion. Let&apos;s hold out for more, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_29_04">You have to keep tabs on Garrett in case he comes back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_91_01">Eight bags. Out-fucking-standing. </string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_08_03">Thanks, it&apos;s good to have some firepower behind me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_36_any_01">Now the hard part.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_27_03">Now hurry up friends, get in there and find the thing we came here for. Garrett probably has it in a safe or something.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_35_any_01">Three more, at least!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_13_02">You can go for the cash after you find the primary target.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_63_02">Just burn it right here on the floor! No fuss!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_31_03">Domkop courier didn&apos;t stash the winch! He&apos;s gonna get it later. Ok friends, I&apos;ll have one coming shortly by train. </string>
	 <string id="loc_des_24_05">Get that power running again, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_14_01">Account reports. But no codes. Try the next one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_12_02">I&apos;m sending the boat, keep bagging the stuff!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_53_03">Dentist said they ship meth outta here. So there must be manufacturing. And meth means money.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_28_03">Take care to enter the correct code.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_48_02">Why are you still outside?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_02_03">I&apos;ve managed to organise some necessary tools for this job. Find them in the crates. They got a little strobe on them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_13_02">Okay, guys. Bile dropped the EMP just outside the lumber mill.Go get it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_66_03">OK, that&apos;s it. When you&apos;ve got the loot inside, you need to juice it up as well.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_32_01">Ach! Those guys are getting very close!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_43_01">Now keep those dwankie Federales away from the bomb until it goes off.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_27_01">I&apos;m going to meet you just outside town. Best way for you to shake these kerel is the sewers. Get down there. I&apos;ve arranged a little something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_54_01">Time lock has started. Should be about four minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_94_03">There&apos;s a boat waiting to pick you up.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_08_03">Tap into the security boxes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_52_01">Restart the hack.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_06_01">That&apos;s one of the machines. Get the hack started, and make sure the cops don&apos;t interefere with our little political sabotage.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_101_03">Stand by, gang. Organizing an exit. Hold the line!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_61_03">C4 that wall, gang! We&apos;re making our own escape route.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_40_02">All right, good find. Now get that gas all over the tires.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_10_03">Right, that looks like what you need.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_31_03">Gotta go into that vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_23_03">Close. So close.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_34_05">Have you forgotten where the mainframe is or something?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_131_02">Seven!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_27_01">Go by the construction site. They must have a laptop there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_08_any_03">Marked a computer. Log me in and I&apos;ll deal with this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_14_any_03">One door left then we get the server. FBIs gonna shit themselves.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_intro_01_02">It&apos;s a big bank, but still a bank. You know the drill. Check the place out, and decide whether to keep things quiet or bring the noise.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_09_03">It&apos;s time to breach the bank! The explosion will take care of the voting machines.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_16_02">Now go open the door. No time to waste.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_27_02">Hope this is the right one.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm1_02_03">You know what happens when you fuck with Russia? Read your history book, asshole!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_08_01">Gonna keep it slow so you guys with the guns can stay with me. </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_104_01">Ach! The federales are breaching walls!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_164_04">You like bread. We got bread. Uh... yeah. Assloads of bread... Sir.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_60_02">What the hell happened? Wrong code? You&apos;re going to need the master code now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_25_03">You get into that computer yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_34_01">Are you looking for something to use?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_57_02">Power&apos;s down. Get BFD reconnected, gang!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_49_any_13">I need 17 more!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_44_02">You let the federales stop the countdown. Go back and restart it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_04_01">So, Vlad. Did I ever tell you about my run-in with an Australian tiger-snake?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_60_02">Empty! Move on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_03_any_01">Get to the generator on the roof and shut it down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_11_03">That the safe&apos;s open. See what we got!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_50_01">Wait for the blimp to get here with the drill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_51_03">Almost there.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt1_03_01">Three minutes...downtown traffic!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_68_02">Those sprinklers put the fire out!</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_21_any_01">Come on! I&apos;m at dock seven!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_83_02">You might find him in one of the interrogation rooms.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_25_02">You&apos;re not supposed to get captured, you chops! We gotta give this one up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_23_02">We&apos;re going to need an X-ray device to get the data the Elephant needs.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_50_any_02">When all that media shows up in their choppers, no one&apos;s gonna look sideways at our escape bird. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_58_03">Chloe&apos;s computer should be nearby.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_32_03">OK, great. Remember both the number and color.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_68_03">The cannon still isn&apos;t charged.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_12_03">Look for the evidence storage!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_62_01">Or maybe don&apos;t do that, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_121_03">Whoa, there goes the system. You need to restart the power so I can resume.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_35_02">Snip snip. Put that bolt cutter to the chains.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_23_01">There, chopper dropped the bag. Go pick up the C4, guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_35_02">There you go. That&apos;s gonna get you through.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_48_01">What are you doing, get inside!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_intro_a_01">Politics can be a bastard but the beauty of it is you always get a second chance. Get in there and do your thing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_40_any_03">OK, we&apos;re inspecting it... So far so good... He&apos;s running tests now...</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_18">Bad news, guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_52_02">The computer is not going to reboot itself!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_68_01">Get that weapon charged, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_24_any_01">Hope they respond as poorly as they usually do... </string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_02_02">You got one of the keycards, now find the other one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_96_01">Get those batteries changed.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_93_01">Good! Now steal one of the police cars and get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_37_03">The lance is on the ground. Fetch it, and set it up. Let&apos;s see who&apos;s in that panic room.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_09_02">Best of luck with your boss and all guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_31_01">People always forget computers in Meeting Rooms. Go see if you can get lucky there.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_06_01">Did you press the right floor? Press the right floor!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_90_02">Make sure the artifacts are stowed aboard the helicopter, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_03_01">The mechanic said he needs his tools from the workshop. Get over there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_69_01">Time to start looking for that stash of Murky loot. We&apos;re looking for cash, and lots of it. </string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_83a_02">Cut open that door with the saw.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_17_02">Jesus fucking Mugabe. Look at this. Fucking pallet broke! You&apos;re going to have to bag all the spilled loot, get it back to the pallet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_12_01">A fully functional methlab! Get cooking, if you see a formula, or scorch the place. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve burned a few methlabs in your time. </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_19_01">OK, let&apos;s have a look...</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_08_01">Locke&apos;s escape plan depends on blasting the radars, gang. See to it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_har_03_01">Hope you guys are holding up in there. Three trucks have pulled over. When the doors open, get at them!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_21_03">Ok, now use that thing to get past the security gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_117_01">You got the coordinates - go.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_11_any_02">Time to escape, guys!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_97_02">Couldn&apos;t hurt to pick up some more things we can sell.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_23_02">Great. Now, please, keep the cops away from the time lock.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_70_01">Blerrie! There goes the alarm!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_46_02">There you go, friends! Now have a look inside that vault!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_05_04">Find the chief&apos;s computer so you can get the evidence files.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_43_01">The train&apos;s ready for the cargo. Check the wagons. Probably loaded. Might find something worthwhile.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_30_02">Come on, take it. It&apos;s not going to open a portal to Hell. Probably.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_47_02">Go ahead. Make some noise, friends.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_16_04">Keep burning those cars, gang. The Commissar will be pissed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_02_03">Come on, crew. Locke needs us to find those crates. Show him how we do it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_59_01">Wait for BFD to crack through the vault. Even this monster will take time. Keep the cops away.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_89_02">Are you still having problems with the Beast?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_06_02">Can&apos;t you find the code?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_02a_02">For a murdering low-life cartel gangster, this guy knows his wine. Shame you don&apos;t have time to take some back.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_16_03">You&apos;ve seen enough TV to know where the West Wing is, so go there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_34_any_03">I like what I&apos;m seeing in there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_91_04">Did you find the garage yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_87_01">Almost... Done. Just a moment now, guys.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_23_07b">I should just have gotten a shitty office job instead...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_100_01">It&apos;s time to head back to the entrance so that I can get you out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_36_04">Keep looking. He&apos;s around there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_100_02">Bag the diamonds and bring them to the garden for zipline extraction.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_08_02">Any luck with that key tag?</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_11">Fuck!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_49_01">Gang. Gensec need the time lock codes. I&apos;ll stall them as long as I can. Can you see them?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_22_01">We need to get into Buluc&apos;s office. The way in can be found in his secret meeting room. See if you can find it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_44_01">...Might be able to hack them with bank computers, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_87_02">The drill has stopped. Get it running again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_31_01">Okay, now we got all we need to steal the EMP parts. Head back to the trains.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_36_02">A friendly chap I was able to &quot;persuade&quot; told me the solution to open this door can be found in what Buluc calls his &quot;inner sanctum&quot;. </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_67_03">But that keycard could be useful.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_43_02">There you go, that&apos;s the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_75_02">You let someone stop the pump. Get over there and start it up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_57_02">The evidence storage is somewhere on the second floor!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_68_02">Haul that gas back to the cars. Light &apos;em up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_75_03">Keep quiet while you bug out of there, and this is a perfect piece of shadow work.</string>
	 <string id="loc_wwh_02_01">So long my little smiling friends!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_28_02">OK, chopper is back. Get pumping again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_04a">Right friends, get ready. And don&apos;t forget- Murky has their top men in this place, so don&apos;t dally. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_44_01">It&apos;s the keycard, for all the good it will do you now. Might have helped us avoid the alarm, but stay focused!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_22_any_06">That&apos;s ten!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_62_02">You gotta get the lights back on quickly.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_09_02">You got the wrong laptop, friends. find the right one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_tap02_01a">Vlad, we don&apos;t have time for this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_14_01">Don&apos;t forget, the C4 is stashed in closets marked with an X.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_62_any_03">Alright, time for me to dash!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_34_03">Come on guys! Remember to get that winch up and running again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_12_any_03">Construction site - cops coming in.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_21_01">Blerrie! It... worked? Ha! Ok, now use it to get past the gates.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_12_01">Mr. Sosa will not disrupt my operations again. Nor will his friends, I think.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_33_02">Hurry up and burn through that gate!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_15_02">That terminal isn&apos;t linking. Murky always had crap IT people, except for me of course. Find another one.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_53a_any_01">We got enough now...</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_dow_03_01">Hot damn! Three trucks are pulled over. Their crews are on the street. Hit them hard!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_37_03">That keycard is one less thing we need to find.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_36_03">I was able to glean that the sequence to this door can be found in Buluc&apos;s &quot;inner sanctum&quot;, somewhere in the house. Get to it, chop chop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_10_01">OK, I&apos;ve got an idea. I can change the hack so it looks like we were here doing this for McCendrick&apos;s rival, Mayor Schwartz. The blame can be passed on to her. If there&apos;s gonna be a scandal, let&apos;s make it a scandal we can use!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_58_01">Guys, the alarm countdown is ticking. You NEED to take care of it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_31_03">See if Garrett is chop enough to have the code in plain sight.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_00_003_01">Get him the tiara and take everything else in the place if you have time... Lot of incidental income you don&apos;t want to waste. Just once you decide to make your move, make it fast.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_58_11">Yeah. For sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_43_any_02">Aha! That&apos;s it! Cold Fusion, right here. You&apos;ve got the keys to his airplane, remember? Get the hell out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_38_01">Box hacked. Seeing fluctuations in their grid. Keep going.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_intro_03_01">You can tell them yourself, domkop.$NL;</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_35_03">Great, you fixed it. Now guard them.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_05a_any_04">I&apos;m coming in two...</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_02g">Right you are old chum, but we do donuts too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_intro_a_01">Pull over here. There&apos;s the warehouse up ahead. Let&apos;s do this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_31_01">That&apos;s it, guys. This will take some time. Just make sure the power stays on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_07_any_02">We don&apos;t have the time to wait around - can&apos;t you find a way in? What about the roof?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_12_01">Check the marked terminals, gang. We&apos;re looking for a code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_121_03">Searching the cases is pointless. You got the bomb, remember?</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_02_01">Those snipers have me pinned down. Can you take them out?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_03_02">Ok. All vehicles stopped.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_10_01">Excellent. Now, let&apos;s just get a detonator on there too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_10_03">Hmm... there seems to be another switchbox. Find it and rewire it, same as the other one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_12_01">Throw the bags into the sea. You can pick them up when you leave.</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_17_any_01">Hector is gonna kill you!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_44_02">Couldn&apos;t hurt to pick up some extra things we can sell.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_intro_01_03">Remember the plan. Get the keycards, keep the civilians in check and set off no alarms. </string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_24_04">Looks like the key tag needs a higher level coding for the armory. You&apos;ll have to recode it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_18_02">The charging has been interrupted! Get it started again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_03_01">Boom! That&apos;s the first.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_25_01">Take that drill inside to the vault room, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_08_01">Well friends, at least something good can come of this. Go find that saw.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_66_01">Find those batteries, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_07_02">Looks like LMG Dozers are part of the assault this time.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_07c_01">Out by the parking lot. Won&apos;t crack open without a saw though, but there&apos;s one of those around here somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_03_01">The key to his heart was in the cars. Now go put a bullet through it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_19_01">Got a zip-line set up there. You can attach any loot bag to it, and get it out nice and quiet. Make the most of it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_72_03">Oh, dear... that&apos;s not going to be like cracking an egg, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_26_09">What a shitty dump.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_91_03">You&apos;ll need to get to the garage!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_63_02">Bingo! Now secure the bomb-parts.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_08_02">The pass phrase is needed when you call Ernesto Sosa. It should be there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_86_02">Look for a code that starts with five.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_66_03">The IT guy has stopped opening the lock. Laanie federales got to him!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_10_01">You gotta get through those bars.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_04_01">Now find the storage room. That&apos;s where the keys&apos;ll be.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_27_02">Raise the balloon! It needs to be higher!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_66_04">Blerrie police reached the IT guy and made him stop overriding the lock. Get in there and make him finish!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_59_02">Here we go... here... we... goooooo!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_46_01">Get out of there, kakspul of trouble is coming!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_103_05">Press the symbols in the correct order.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_05_02">Good friends, now get to the cell block so we can find and release Bain.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_06_03">Do you know if Mr Pink was captured?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_44_02b">Sounds like a kakspul of trouble...</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_02_03">Fuck! The Hondurans! They&apos;re here! They&apos;re going to kill us!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_91_02">Hop on the chopper friends! Bile wants to make like a tree and get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_30_03">Easy as pie! Now where is he?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_02c">Nah, friend it&apos;s in the batter, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_51_02">No no no, that can&apos;t be correct. Get another barcode.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_68_03">Something&apos;s wrong with the drill. Start it again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_61_03">The case might have the explosives. Check it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_52_03">Jump down into the vault and get the dough!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_08_03">We got that one hacked. Keep looking at it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_98_02">You need to power up the cannon.</string>
	 <string id="bkl_brn_01_01">Payback!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_10_03">Right, now the vault itself is behind a security gate and you&apos;ll need to get past it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_end_a_01">That was an excellent piece of whisper-work. They didn&apos;t know you were there. Now let&apos;s see where that truck leads us.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_26_03">This area has several vaults, which can be opened from a control room. We want what&apos;s in the vaults so necessity demands we get to the control room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_02_03">The BCI tech is supposed to be in a car in the front of the train, so that&apos;s your destination.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_intro_02b">Why do laanie dwankies always host secret parties in old mansions, when it&apos;s raining outside?</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_15_01">I&apos;m gonna need the car key here, guys.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_06_03">C&apos;mon friends, get to the cell blocks.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_02">This is one tail I can&apos;t lose!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_51_01">Here she comes. &quot;BFD&quot;. Stands for &quot;Big Goddamn Drill&quot;. Almost.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_06_any_07">No more! There&apos;s no more room!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_91_01">Have you got both boxes onto the helicopter?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_02_any_04">This is R.G. here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_85_02">Look for a code that starts with four.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_01_03">...Get those civvies under control, cop cars are about one minute out, friends.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_41_any_05">Nine to go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_27_04">Good! There should be lots of nice things in here!</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_08_02">Great, at least this fiasco isn&apos;t a total loss.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01b_any_11">It&apos;s the police! They&apos;re tailing us!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_garage_02_any_02">Work your way up to street level, I have a van ready to get you guys out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_20_01">You&apos;ll have to overheat the system to cause a soft reboot and gain access to the controls. Then we should be able to get that server.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_06_07">Alright man, you know what you&apos;re doing. Just don&apos;t want this shit biting our asses later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_125_01">This is Randolph. Roberts Bank is happy to serve you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_106_01">Get to the library!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_61_02">BFD&apos;s tanks are drained. You can refill them in the bathroom. She&apos;s not fussy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_10_01">There&apos;s the ladder and thermite. Grab &apos;em. You&apos;ll need them later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_07_any_01">Ah, OK! I&apos;m getting some juicy stuff here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_end_05">Crime.net is buzzing - you guys pulled off a nice little upset here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_75_04">Still too much blocking the square, get it cleared!</string>
	 <string id="geo_glc_04_01">Shit, I missed. I&apos;ll come around and make another attempt. Hold out for another minute or so!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_87_02">That did it. They&apos;re all fast asleep. No need to worry about cameras from here on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_91_03">Both boxes need to be secured on the heli before boarding.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_73_01">There&apos;s gotta be something special about that thing if they keep it locked up in here. Maybe take it with you, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_22_01">They&apos;re going for the hostage. Stop them!</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_08_02">What&apos;s the delay over there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_29_01">Sales-people always have laptops.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_47_01">Blerrie! There&apos;s a lockdown engaged. You&apos;ll have to find the server room and override it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_39_02">Now the vaults exposed, we&apos;re going to drill down. A big drill. Which needs a winch. Signal Bile with a flare when you&apos;re ready.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_87_01">You need to restart the drill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_intro_a_02">That&apos;s the depot where the machines are kept. Move out, you clowns.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_27_02">You got to unscrew all the screws, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_32_01">You should be searching, not dawdling.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_12_01">All right, the BCI tech is in safe hands now. You still have the opportunity to go back to the wagon and get more loot. It&apos;s all worth good cash.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_05_02">Ah, perfect. You now take hose to pump.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_47_01">Almost done...</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_14_02">Don&apos;t get distracted by the beautiful little town. You&apos;re looking for a fuck-ton of money, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_75_02">Can&apos;t blast through that friends, but have a look at the security reader there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_39_03">OK, Vlad... OK....</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_126_01">Roberts Bank. Everything&apos;s under control. How can I help you?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_27_03">Not much time. Hope this is the right one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_22a_02">It might be well hidden. Have you looked in the bookshelves?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_48_03">Remember, you must apply the C4 to each of those radars.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_92_03">If you can find some fuel, wire, a timer and maybe some mulch- I mean fertilizer, then we can get it done, for sure!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_17_01">Protect the timer, the swats will interrupt it if you don&apos;t!</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_19_07">Bah, that offer is for chops. We can make them do better fo&apos; sho&apos;. Stay frosty, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_104_03">Attach the car so you can fly out of here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_19_01">Now if the cameras are giving you a hard time, there&apos;s a surveillance operator around. He&apos;s in the security office.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_07_01">They have me pinned down - I can&apos;t get the door open!</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_05_04">This is funniest thing I watch since execution video. Now, that funny.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_123_03">Right, the numbers for the code are...</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_83_02">Still got a box on the conveyor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_92_01">Ok, now use the thermite you found on those shutters.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_14_01">Find that evidence yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_90_03">Check the owners office for his briefcase. Pit boss will be around the main hall. The locker room is where the security chief&apos;s briefcase likely is.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_98_07">Activate the charge cycle on that gun.</string>
	 <string id="btc_fri_01_03">If he&apos;s not going to stick his head out, we&apos;ll have to draw him out. Start destroying his things and see if that makes him mad enough to come out and fight.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_78_02">OK, time to get in that vault. Chop chop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_28_03">Management would be a good place to look for a laptop.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_13_02">Can you please loose ship from dock!</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_21_any_01">I gotta leave in a minute!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_58_03">You still have to stop the code from changing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_23_01">Did you catch that, gang? Bile will drop off the C4 on the roof in a couple of minutes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_end_win_01">Well done, friends. Well done! We got our man back. Bain... is home. But the Murkys have done something to him. I&apos;ve got some professionals looking at him right now and they say it&apos;s some kind of virus, maybe manufactured. If he dies... oh, blerrie Locke is going to be mad and make those Kataru pay...</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_93_04">I think the wine cellar is a good place to look for fertilizer.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_08_01">So what do you really know about these Payday guys? Can&apos;t imagine this shit is our fault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_79_02">Look out above, friends! The beast cometh from on high!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_71_03">Something interrupted the charge cycle. You have to restart it.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_24">Woah-woah-woah-woah!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_09_03">Let&apos;s meet in the building next door. You can probably enter from the roof.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_07_03">We&apos;ve learned that most of the time, you can find Buluc in his office brooding over something, so it&apos;s a good place to look for him. Find it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_20_03b">Come on, where&apos;s that coke? I&apos;m thirsty!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_01_01">Right, friends. Nice and quiet, yeah? First thing you gotta do is get past security. Go to the gate and have a look at the barriers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_09_01">We&apos;re gonna need to burn or cut through those bars. See if you can find something around there to do it with.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_13_02">Oh, dear. You&apos;re not going to break that open without making a lotta noise.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_end_b_01">The Mendoza cartel just got knocked on its ass. Nothing hurts like taking a financial beating and they just took a big one. Hector will rise and that&apos;s good fortune for us down the line. </string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_48_02">Who said the buses in this town can&apos;t keep to a schedule! Get moving that loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_20_any_01">Crap, the cops must have recieved a call.</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_18_any_01">Doors are open for you, we are leaving!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_tap01_02a">Just your friendly neighborhood kek, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_04b_any_03">... on my way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_116_01">The CFO is still there. Keep your eyes open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_89_04">Come on friends, just a little more. Get that dinges running again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_05_01">Blerrie, They&apos;re sending in Cuff Cloakers along with this group.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_19_03">Found a phone yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_21_01">My eyes aren&apos;t what they were. Help an old man out and light a flare, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_20_01">Quickly, get the power back before the guests get suspicious.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_14_any_03">By the factory - cops incoming.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_14_04">Once you get that stowed, you can get another one going.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_36_02">You cutting though yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_06_03">Holy...! They rigged the boxes with C4! Defuse them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_03_01">That&apos;s it! Now plant the C4 in the underground garage. Our Inside Man has marked the ceiling beneath the vault. That&apos;s where the C4 goes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_32_03">Nothing stopping us from getting our hands on the EMP. Get back to the trains.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_89_03">Hurry now, secure the artifact on the chopper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_03_02">We gotta get the USB stick. The head of security should have it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_end_a_02">We pulled Mendoza&apos;s teeth on that job - destroying those weapons is gonna leave him with a lot more bark than bite. I bet Hector bumps us up the food chain for sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58g_02">Open up the door to the garage and tape a can of gasoline to one of the cars.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_116_02">I need to be patched into the mainframe so I can hack the system.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_48_02">Maria wants to hitch-hike but has no thumbs.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_14_02">Have you forgotten what Bain looks like? Try again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_86_01">The saw, the saw.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_18_03">Needed diesel is now at half.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_45_02">Heads-up, friends. Murky agents on the way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_64_03">What!? That&apos;s what those Kataru are after? Quickly now, grab it and get out of there ASAP.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_20_03">Good, now get out to the main hub and use the crane to pull the box out of storage, yeah.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_05_any_02">Fill me up, I&apos;ll come back for seconds if you stay around!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_09_02">Get up to the second floor using the scaffolding. See if there&apos;s a weak area in the floor or something.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_82_03">The code begins with a one, according to my source.</string>
	 <string id="hnc_man_01_02">Mr. Sturr, I presume? You got the data? </string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_44_01">JACKPOT!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_19_any_01">Don&apos;t fuck up now, you are almost there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_10_any_03">Hang on - too much heat for a pick-up.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_18_01">They got me. But it&apos;s ok, just a minor flesh wound.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_67_03">Looks like they switched off the power, friends. You need to restart it.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_32_03">I&apos;ll be glad to see the back of this place!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_71_01">You gotta get that code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_43_02">I&apos;m putting you through to our CEO. Please hold.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_71_02">Start hacking, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_48_04">Get to the mainframe and override the lockdown!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_27_02">Close the door in their faces. Blast the gas!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_06_03">You need to cover me while open the gate!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_08_03">Good, now there should be an RFID security box. You need to get through that gate. Have a closer look.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_26_01">How are you coming along with that drill, friends?</string>
	 <string id="btf_cs1_01_06">Is there anything else I can help you with, ma&apos;am? Would be interested in an auto loan?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_50_02">Can&apos;t unlock the doors until you patch in properly.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_04_04">Stop standing around. Open the doors. Fuck me, what&apos;s wrong with you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_03_02">The switch there will open the cargo doors!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_63_03">Good, now get into the office!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_14">Damn damn damn!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_87_04">Keep protecting the drill.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_74_02">It&apos;s on the ground floor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_52_01">C&apos;mon friends, you need to get mixing.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_55_01">Ach, they must&apos;ve picked something up. They&apos;re calling the PEOC. Patch me through. And cross your fingers.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_29_02">Now get to the safe and open it up.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_09_02">You must check pump. Is not working.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_intro_05b">They got their Top. Men.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_26_03">Clear the way, I&apos;ve got Bain!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_13_05">Get to the computer lab, find the shelf, then go and use the crane.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_116_01">Help me hack into the mainframe computer. Maybe I can take care of the vault from there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_21_03">The door won&apos;t open until the shrine is complete. Find all the pieces.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_66_05">The override has been interrupted! They got to the IT guy, make him resume!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58f_02">There should be some nice, expensive cars in the garage. Use one of those to destroy the turret.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_47_03">Let&apos;s go with the other plan. No need to keep quiet!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_10_02">That&apos;s it, now you just gotta go get those pretty rocks, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_09_01">Get up to the second floor and look for a weakness in the floor or something, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_44_03">...Bank computers should be able to open them up, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_52_03">Ach! Some poes has been joyriding this bird. Gas is empty. Can you be a good chap and hook up the fuel line?</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_04_01">I need to open this gate. Give me a minute!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_90_02">Look for a code that starts with nine.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_64_04">Eish, didn&apos;t see that one coming. The Elephant had one too? Just take it and get out, we&apos;ll figure this out later, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="gsc_cs1_03_02">Well, look... I&apos;m going to send some guys over there to check things out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_28_05">You still need to find the safe, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_14_03">No, that&apos;s not Bain&apos;s cell. Try another one.</string>
	 <string id="hoxton_hb3_debrief_01_02">That&apos;s it for that rat fucking shite Hector. How could he turn like that? Cowardly twat. Well done lads.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_18_02">You&apos;re eventually going to have to get past that gate, since it leads into the more secure areas.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_20">Yeah, die you fucking cuiter. </string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_92_01">Either get on the chopper or find some more loot!</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_29_01">This is the wrong fucking key!</string>
	 <string id="crn_man_intro_01">Crane ready.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_15_01">I am so glad to hear that!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_58_05">Put the finished chemical on the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_04_03">Ah, nice of the keks to leave this lying around for you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_71_03">Don&apos;t stay there, get to the skylight.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_33_01">Shit! They blocked the exits! We can&apos;t get out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_08_03">Have a go with the thermite you found. Should burn through nicely.</string>
	 <string id="brs_pt2_intro_02">Can you guys help me get the goats in here.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_02_01">Heads-up friends, you got a bunch of dwankies incoming! Mr. Blonde, you look after that kêrel while the boys take care of the others!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_47_01">Blerrie! He&apos;s back in his office. Need to get him out again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_68_01">Now what? Looks like a firewall backup is running. Find a computer to terminate it with.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_33_03">It&apos;s a masterpiece. Thought lost for decades. I&apos;d hang it in my crapper, but it&apos;s worth a shitload of cash.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_07_05">I can&apos;t get the door open if you don&apos;t cover me!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_31_02">That looks heavy, friends. Use the conveyor in the main hub to move it back to the extraction point.</string>
	 <string id="com_hm2_02_01">Smile for the camera, assholes. I see you. Yes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_68_03">You gotta set up a flare so Bile knows where to come get you.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_77a_01">You have to restart the hacking!</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_76_03">You&apos;re going to need the code for it. Start searching.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01a_any_25">I can not fucking believe this shit!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_97_03">We&apos;re going to need to fund some upgrades soon, so feel free to grab some more loot.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_10">They&apos;re shooting at our tires!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_03_01">There you go, that&apos;s it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_27_01">And you&apos;re in!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_98_03">The cannon still isn&apos;t charged.</string>
	 <string id="bot_wd2_14_any_04">I got to leave in a minute!</string>
	 <string id="bot_watchdogs_new_stage2_23_any_01">Ten more seconds and I&apos;m gone!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_16_01">Come now, everyone inside! Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_85_01">Kerels have reset the control box. You need to restart the shutdown.</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_19_01">Only little more diesel.</string>
	 <string id="dlr_framing_stage2_10_any_01">It&apos;s not that we don&apos;t trust you, we just need to make sure that nothing will happen.</string>
	 <string id="elp_election_brf_speak_01">The voting will begin tomorrow. We need to act now to make a difference. New voting machines have arrived in the harbor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_30_01">All right, my dear friends. That&apos;s enough loot to make this op worthwhile. You decide if you want to keep going. Every extra dollar, rand and rouble strengthens our friendship, yeah? For sure.</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_03_04">Those snipers will get me soon if you don&apos;t take them out!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_87_02">Now get those chains off him!</string>
	 <string id="bul_fex_tap06_02">What? Who is this?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_51_02">Now see how you can get access to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_05_03">If you patch me into the security boxes for the storage room, I can unlock the doors to it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_63_03">It&apos;d be best to just burn it here! Put it on the floor!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_60_01">Shit, those fucking shit-eating kerels shut down the unlocking. Get it going again!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_01_02">Ah! So Winston called you. Can you help me out here?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_24_01">You need to hack the auctioneer&apos;s computer for the code, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_38_02">There&apos;s hidden entrance behind that shrine, but the quickest way in will be to blow it open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_55_01">....Don&apos;t take too long. Got a feeling my old friends at Murky have been tracking our movements.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_09_02">Nicely done, now get to the other one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_86_01">Can&apos;t get in there with a key now, you gotta use a drill instead.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_34_any_02">Get two more!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_16_02">That&apos;s it friends, good work.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_43_02">Everyone knows you&apos;re there now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_23_02">Ok, Bain is now heading for the roof. Keep following him.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_62_02">Hurry up and get to the weapons lab.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_02_02">...Coppers incoming any second now, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_15_02">Now find some way to destroy it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_68_02">The bank has a backup software firewall. You&apos;ll have to find the right computer to kill it, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_22_03">Of course, there could be another way past security...</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_tap01_02">Nice guy, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_37_01">We need to get him out of that prisoner outfit. Find him a spare police uniform!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_70_06">The cannon isn&apos;t going to fire itself.</string>
	 <string id="alm_pex_01_01">What... hey! Did Vlad send you to get me out?</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_88_01">You need to cut those restraints so we can get the prisoner out of here.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_43_any_07">Eleven more, at least!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_26_01">Now get back to the armory and see if you can find something to use on the cell block door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_34_01">Fuck knows what that thing is. They say it has a curse. Makes your nose look like a dick. So why people pay craploads for it, I don&apos;t know.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_09_03">...You need to hack a terminal in the mainframe and figure out where to start looking, yeah? </string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_18_01">That gate will get you into the more secure areas of the bank.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_51_01">They got to the computer! Restart the hack!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_01">...I reckon.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_03_02">I hate to bother you,I really do, but finding the crates is our primary objective.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_59_03">The code is likely in the auctioneer&apos;s office, but you gotta get in there first. The auctioneer has a keycard to the door. Make him give it to you!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_19_03">When I find out who did this, they will pay!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_12_02">The elevator isn&apos;t working, I can&apos;t get up! Listen - I need you to find something for me up there - it&apos;s a metal briefcase that they took from me. It&apos;s very important!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_intro_01_01">Ghaa! What the blerrie!? Vlad, you dronkie chop,what...!? Get out of here!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_22">...I&apos;m 86% sure.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_03b_any_01">... just sit tight!</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_54a_any_01">That&apos;s all of them! Nice!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01c_any_01">I can&apos;t shake &apos;em!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_51_04">It&apos;s time to go, friends!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_14_01b">Is the pickup coming? This is getting pretty hot!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_24_01">Follow Bain to the roof!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_04_06">I&apos;m betting on caustic soda.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_71_01">Damn kerels have stopped the charge process. Get it going again!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_19">Hold on for dear life!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb1_05_01">Shit! Bollards are up?! Fix it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_30_03">OK, the thermite is through. Nasty but beautiful. Now set up the winch, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="cpt_wwh_11_03">Diesel oil is pumping again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_22_02">...it got dumped in the containers at the construction site. Go out and get it.</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_03a_any_03">Arriving in four...</string>
	 <string id="bot_gen_12_any_04">Deliver the bags!</string>
	 <string id="cha_spa_08_04">Whoever they are, it seems they chose poorly in ambushing me.</string>
	 <string id="dr1_a01d_any_05">They&apos;re fucking firing at the tires!</string>
	 <string id="dr1_hb2_02_02">What were you guys doing up there?! Nevermind. The less I know. Just get down here.</string>
	 <string id="hoxton_hb3_debrief_01_01">That fucking rat Hector is dead. Good. Fucking good. Well done lads.</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_74_01">Time to bring in the Beast! Get outside and clear the square!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bex_97_01">You&apos;re all done, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_24_03">You gotta get up to the roof!</string>
	 <string id="loc_bph_33_02">Ach, another bloody problem. Find the control box and hack into it so we can get through.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_12_01">Get that saw off there, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_24_03">If you run short of equipment, go take another look at the drop site.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_36_02">...you need to move all parts of the winch into the bank.</string>
	 <string id="loc_brb_cnc_02">The Brooklyn Bank has got something we need, and for once it isn&apos;t just cash!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_07_04">Hurry friends, get in there and search.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_100_02">Ready to get out of there? Make your way back to the entrance so I can arrange your extraction.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_105_04">You have to redo the bypass on those security boxes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_22_04">The crane isn&apos;t moving. Damn Murky has stopped it. Go and get it running again, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_25_03">Have a look around for something you can use to force that crate open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_29_01">Ah, there we go. One box of strangeness. Pick it up and get onto the next one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_35_02">Ok, friends. Looks like they&apos;re keeping one of the boxes in the archaeology room. Get over there now, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_39_03">The drill has stopped. Damn kerels!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_39_04">Restart the drill, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_44_02">Don&apos;t forget the box, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_46_02">When did you guys go losing those?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_47_01">Ok, you have to get back to the mainframe and look for the second box.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_56_03">Friends, they stopped your cookout, yeah? You need to redo it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_60_01">Hurry and pick up the box, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_65_03">There should be some power cells around there for you to connect to it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_66_07">Plug in some batteries, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_70_03">The cannon is ready. Fire it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_70_05">What are you waiting for, fire the cannon!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_72_04">Get that cannon charging again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_82_03">...And take the boxes from the conveyor end, at the entrance. They should be waiting for you, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_87_02">What in the gods&apos; names is.... I can&apos;t believe it... is that...? Ach! Bekakin&apos; bastards! Get out of there, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_des_91_02">Load the artifacts, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_09_01">I had a guy bribe one of Buluc&apos;s old girlfriends. You can apparently find the way to open this door in something he calls his &quot;inner sanctum&quot;. So, maybe find the entrance to that place first, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_31_05">Don&apos;t forget the garage.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_34_02">Hurry up and find Buluc&apos;s office. </string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_39b_02">Looks like what we need... right over there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_58i_02">If you want more room to maneuver, move the van out of the way.</string>
	 <string id="loc_fex_84_01">Get the door open!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_04_03">There is a keycard, an arc cutter and a small number of breaching charges, that you must collect. Blasting in is crude, but it will help deflect suspicion from me.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_07_01">Remember, drop the charges near the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_07_02">Let me check my records. Yes, I mentioned that the charges must be dropped near the door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_13_02">Any... second...</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_21_02">Bakgat! Now, onwards, my friends. The airlock awaits you!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_45_03">This cache of C4 should deal with the radars, yes?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_05">He knew he was going to die tonight. Just knew it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_57_15">Why was he there? He&apos;s the cook!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_60_03">Hey, what happened? Ah, shit - cops interrupted the vault. Get it going again. And kill the fucking cops.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_62_02">You do all the killing, yeah? I&apos;m cyberwarfare, not a fucking commando. My uniform should keep me out of the fray.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_62_03">I need you guys to distribute the violence, yeah? My uniform should let me blend in with them, keep out of the fight.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr1_63_02">Protocol means they&apos;ll have snipers ready to ambush up ahead. You fellas watch yourselves, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_02_04">Out of that compartment! </string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_09_01">And out the door you go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_16_02">I don&apos;t care if you gotta shinny up a wall like fucking Spiderman. Look everywhere for that third pallet.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_22_02">I&apos;m flying in. Don&apos;t shoot if you see a big fucking helicopter flying at you, right?</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_27_02">I will meet you on the edge of town, but I don&apos;t want you bringing the whole fucking cop army. Get in the sewers. I&apos;ve organised transport.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_29_01">Grab that paste and burn through the gate. Fucking hell.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_39_01">It looks like one of the pallets landed on the roof of the diner. Imagine all that money falling in your eggs and grits, eh! For sure.</string>
	 <string id="loc_jr2_44_02">Yet another successful collaboration! You have my thanks, my admiration and, most importantly, your share of the money.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_02_01">The tunnel entrance should be outside somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_10_02">Fast work, friends. </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_13_02">Groot job with the code.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_16_03">Time to go to Mexico, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_30_02">You gotta get some fuel in that dinges. Get to work. </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_33_02">The pump needs to be filled with gasoline.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_39_01">You have to clear the runway, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_45_03">Murky dwankies coming your way!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_54_01">There you go! Take them and set them on the door!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_74_01">Time to juice up that plane. Get the fuel hose connected. </string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_80_02">You need to blow the runway gates. It&apos;s gonna be jol!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_83_03">More dwankies incoming. You gotta get out of there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_07_01">Wait, cancel that...</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_07_02">Hold up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_10_03">Use hydrogen chloride!</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_03">...IF old Locke&apos;s calculations are correct.</string>
	 <string id="loc_mex_cook_11_19">...it&apos;s a toss-up, really.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_07_02">Their doors open with coded key tags. See if you can find a blank one that we can code.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_08_06">Remember, you need to find a blank key tag.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_105_03">Connect the wires!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_11_02">Use your key to get into the evidence storage. It should be on the second floor.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_13_03">It&apos;s search and destroy, friends! Step one - search!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_22_04">No drill will break that door. But the armory might have something that can take care of it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_36_01">What are you waiting for? Cut him loose.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_36_02">Cut him loose!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_38_02">Any luck on finding that uniform? Try the locker room!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_42_03">Sort that door out.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_45_02">You&apos;ll need to figure out which key is the right one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_55_04">You need to get in there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_64_01">Just put the stuff in a pile on the floor for now.</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_64_04">Place the evidence on the floor so you can burn it!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_71_03">Don&apos;t let them start those sprinklers!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_73_03">Look for the custody cell block!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_73_04">You need to find the cell block!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_75_01">You need to find that armory, friends!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_81_02">That door breaker will be perfect for the job! Take it to the cell block door!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_81_04">Perfect! Now take that thing to the cell block door and blast it open!</string>
	 <string id="loc_pex_85_03">You&apos;ll need to get some tools. He&apos;s chained up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_run_01_01">I&apos;ve got a driver who can help you. Eddie, get there now! You need to pick the Payday Gang up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_run_05_02">Follow Bile so he can pick you up in a safer spot! Don&apos;t forget Roscoe!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_07_01">Sounds like he&apos;s not too far away, yeah? Go get him!</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_11_07">You gotta open up those storage units, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_rvd_12_02">There&apos;s the bag, get it to Mr Blonde, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_03_03">Find the nearby power box and disable it. Should kill those metal detectors.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_100_02">Cut through there with that nice blowtorch you found.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_102_03">That was the wrong code, friends! You need to wait for the system to clear.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_10_03">There, now go ahead. The doors are open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_12_03">They&apos;ve got some nasty security in place, but they didn&apos;t count on old Locke, yeah? Put a blocker on that keypad to stop the code from cycling.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_20_03">Hurry and turn the power back on.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_21_03">Well, no need to be quiet now. They know something is going on!</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_23_03">You have to go into the office.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_26_01">Now check the screen for the code, then go and open the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_32_02">O kaek, I wasn&apos;t counting on that. Never can it be easy.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_33_03">Maybe you can find something to get in there. Have a look in the utility closet if you can find it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_34_03">C&apos;mon, you gotta have a good look around.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_38_02">Hurry friends, send it out of there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_43_03">Right there on the feed... that&apos;s the vault.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_60_01">You need that keycard, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_63_01">Nicely done. Now get into that office, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_65_02">Too late friends, the auctioneer is gone. Drill the door open instead.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_77_03">You have to wait for the time lock to end before you can get in. Shouldn&apos;t take too long.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_83_01">That&apos;s gonna be useful, for sure. Now get back and burn it open.</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_84_01">How is it going?</string>
	 <string id="loc_sah_88_01">Chopper is almost there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_09_02">Medic Dozers coming as well. Bunch of kakspul!</string>
	 <string id="loc_skm_26_02">Good job, everyone. That chop gave us an OK bundle of money to take home, but next time maybe we&apos;ll do better.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_01_03">Before we do anything else, we gotta get you past the security gate, so go have a look at what we&apos;re dealing with, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_03_07">How about that security, friends?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_06_04">Any whiteboards nearby?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_11_02">You took too long.  Gotta go back and hack it again.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_23_02">You should be able to get past the code lock by disabling a few security boxes around there.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_24_05">Get to those security boxes.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_26_01">Now go and short out the pad by Garrett&apos;s door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_27_02">Quickly friends, get inside the office and get what we&apos;re here for. Garrett&apos;s bound to have it in a safe.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_32_01">Garrett likes history, so maybe something... historical?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_33_01">Maybe something historical, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_34_01">Garrett is married, so maybe his wife&apos;s birthday or anniversary?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_36_02">Could be that the code is related to Garrett&apos;s crusade against us, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_39_01">Keep looking for something too obvious.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_42_03">How did you get that so quick? Maybe I can just go have a coffee and let you sort things alone, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_61_02">C&apos;mon friends, put some food by Garrett&apos;s door.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_68_02">Maybe it will unlock the evidence room. Take it and go find it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_68_03">With a bit of luck, that will get us into the evidence room. Quickly, take it and go.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_69_01">The last intel I got put it on the other side of the building, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_69_02">It&apos;s on the other side of the building.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_75_05">Nothing left to do but make like a bush, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_76_03">Remember that movie where one person in the lift goes bossies and just eviscerates everyone?</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_77_01">Right, Twitch... you&apos;re up. Might want to cover your ears, friends.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_81_04">There is still loot to be secured.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_86_01">The code should have a five at the beginning.</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_92_03">There we go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_tag_intro_03f">Yeah, it&apos;s go time.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_03_02">Keep your eyes on the Murkys and don&apos;t get too close. Even with those uniforms, you might get spotted.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_05_02">Huh. That wasn&apos;t too hard. Suppose it&apos;s true- any old dwankie can get in there!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_09_03">Interesting. OK, those lights have some kind of connectors around there. See if you can find them.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_102_03">That takes care of the safe. Now you can open it up!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_105_01">Ok, I&apos;ve got intel that mentions a hidden entrance to the PEOC near the library. Get over there ASAP.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_110_02">There we go, just like in the movies. </string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_111_01">Now hurry up and get inside the airlock!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_117_03">You gotta get me into that computer system!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_120_01">Almost... done...</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_121_01">Bunch of kakspul! I lost power. You gotta get me back up again!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_124_03">Stupid machine taking forever to update...</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_126_02">Nicely done!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_126_03">OK, good!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_130_03">There&apos;s a blocker on the system. Get to another terminal and help me break it.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_131_02">You gotta help me get through! Get to a terminal.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_135_01">That&apos;s what we came for. Take them and let&apos;s go!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_137_03">Time to leave the PEOC, hurry!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_18_03">You gotta get the keycard from the Oval Office.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_19_02">Most likely, the keycard will be inside a safe or something. Look around for one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_20_01">Look behind things. Should be fairly obvious, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_24_03">Look through the laptops, chop chop!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_24_05">Have you gone through all the laptops yet?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_28_03">You can use pretty much any laptop to access the USB stick.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_36_01">Right, now my intel doesn&apos;t say exactly where the entrance is, so you&apos;ll have to rummage around a bit.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_39_01">That has to be the way into the PEOC. Get into the airlock.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_42_01">Ach, it&apos;s one of those. Liquid nitrogen would take care of it, but unless you brought some without telling me we&apos;ll have to make other arrangements.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_45_01">Alright, I&apos;m in. Give me a little time.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_49_03">I can&apos;t do anything unless you restore the power.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_55_03">Incoming call to the PEOC. Put me through and hope we haven&apos;t been discovered.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_57_02">There, now let&apos;s move on to the next one.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_63_02">Bad news friends. I just picked up some chatter and they&apos;re closing off the air space. You need to leave. Now!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_69_01">Friends, I&apos;m waiting for you!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_77_01">OK, take a look around and see if you can find something to get us past that gate.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_81_01">Don&apos;t let the enemies interrupt the hack.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_81_02">You gotta make sure those Murkys don&apos;t interfere!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_85_01">Get to the West Wing! There&apos;s no time to dally.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_86_01">Enter the Oval Office so you can get the keycard!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_87_02">The Oval Office is right there, so get inside.</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_90_02">My intel indicates that they have piled up some dangerous compounds there somewhere. See what you can find to use on that barrier, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_91_02">Keep looking for something strong- you need to get through that barrier!</string>
	 <string id="loc_vit_99_03">You&apos;ll need to get it some juice from a wall socket.</string>
	 <string id="loc_wwh_01_01">Sorry friends, I would have liked to do this another way, but I was made an offer I couldn&apos;t say no to!</string>
	 <string id="loc_wwh_02_03">Have a beautiful day friends, until we never meet again!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_04_01b">O&apos;boy, here they come!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_05_03b">I should just have ran when I had the chance...</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_08_01b">Holy shit, it&apos;s like a god damn warzone out here! I&apos;m gonna stay here while you go around and do whatever you do. Find the parts and bring them back here.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_09_02b">My special tools. Yes, I definitely need my special tools, and you&apos;ll find those in the workshop. Look out for toolboxes.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_12_02b">Oh, yeah. Wait. You&apos;re gonna need this blowtorch to get inside.</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_19_03b">Not only bikes needs juice to get going, if you get what I&apos;m sayin&apos;? No? Dammit, just get me a coke from the vending machine, will ya?</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_21_02b">Okay, that should do! What&apos;s next?</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_22_01b">Hey! What the fuck! Get these fucking cops off my ass!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_22_05b">What the hell! Keep &apos;em off of me!</string>
	 <string id="mch_brn_23_06b">Too fucking close... Too fucking close...</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_07_03">So, here&apos;s some good news and bad news. Bad news is my car died. Good news is that I had time to grab some diamonds from the trunk. They&apos;re in a storage unit nearby.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_16_02">Wow, you guys are kinda entertaining. I saw parts flyin&apos; all the way out here.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_16_03">That was, you know, kind of a big explosion.</string>
	 <string id="mrb_rvd1_30_01">Yeah, about that. It&apos;s out here. In my car.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_01_01">Hey, can anyone hear me? What the goddamn fuck is going on? I&apos;m comin&apos; in hot... took a cap in the side.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_02_01">Hey, I&apos;m here... outside... not far from the street! Piece of shit car!</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_04_03">Shit, man I&apos;m dyin&apos; out here. What&apos;d ya do, stop for a hot dog?</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_07_06">Diamond jobs always turn into fuckin&apos; bloodbaths. Heard they had to scrape a guy off the floor once with a shovel &apos;cause of all the dried blood.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_07_08">Wish I were at a burger joint with my girl right now.</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_10_02">OH, FUCK! they got Brown!</string>
	 <string id="mrp_rvd_12_02">Who fuckin&apos; booked this job?</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_01_07">Good day sir.</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_02_04">Right!</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_03_04">Right!</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_05_03">Yeah-yeah-yeah... Run the plan!</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_05_04">Right!</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_05_07">I was gonna light up. You ain&apos;t gonna arrest me are you?</string>
	 <string id="nmh_intro_06_02">Why does it feel like I shouldn&apos;t be here right now?</string>
	 <string id="ope_hb3_01_02">Right. Yeah. OK, here it is. 8394. Don&apos;t share it, alright?</string>
	 <string id="ope_hb3_01_03">Copy that. Let me pull it up...it&apos;s 8394. Don&apos;t let it get out.</string>
	 <string id="plc_cs1_01_02">This is Captain Rogers of the MPDC. We got a call from Gensec. Seems they got some concerns about what&apos;s happening there. I&apos;m dispatching some uniformed officers to make sure everything&apos;s OK.</string>
	 <string id="plc_cs1_01_03">Captain Rogers here. We got a call from your private security firm. They have some concerns. So for everybody&apos;s safety, I&apos;m routing some officers to your location. </string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_01_01">Loud or quiet - your call. But if we can stealth this, we&apos;ll be able to blend in and escape with the crowd. Nice and easy. </string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_04_03">Perfect! Now, to mask the explosions, we need to time the concerts pyros. Get up to the booth and patch me in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_07_01">Bile&apos;s on his way with the chopper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_07_02">I&apos;m sending Bile your way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_08_02">Ok, nice and easy. Just get those masks off, blend in with the crowd and we won&apos;t have any issues. The van will be waiting for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_08_03">Alright, that&apos;s it for the concert. Time to de-mask and blend in with the crowd. If all goes to plan, you&apos;ll be able to stroll right out the front door. Good luck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_10_02">Sit tight, gang. The helicopter will be back to pick you guys up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_12_01">Police signal&apos;s going nuts. They must&apos;ve been deployed near the arena already.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_12_02">Cops&apos; switchboard lit up. Guess they had their people in the area.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_14_02">Head in the game, guys. Look for the closets marked with the X.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_14_03">C4 is what we&apos;re after, remember. You&apos;ll find it in the closets marked with the X.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_15_01">That&apos;s one of the doors. Lockpick away if you like it sneaky.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_18_02">All right. There&apos;s one of the marked closets.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_20_03">Our last closet door, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_21_08">Feel that bass.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_23_03">All right. More C4. Almost got all we need now. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_25_02">Don&apos;t forget - the garage is where you need to plant the C4.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_33_01">The left and the middle console. Hit them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_34_01">Okay, hit the middle and right console. Go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_36_02">The C4 did its job. Get that vault floor cut open. Impenetrable my ass!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_37_01">Come on, guys. You have to get the cutters onto the vault floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_38_03">Cutter is done. Watch your heads - here comes the money!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_40_01">I saw a conveyor chute over there. Throw the loot in, and it&apos;ll shift it to the lobby.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_42_01">Miso Prawny!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_49_02">The chopper can&apos;t wait forever, crew. Get the loot up there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_50_03">Almost done, guys. Just answer that intercom when you&apos;re ready to get your masks off and get out of there. Secure what you want to take first!</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_53_03">No other way out. Get into that container, gang. And hope the cable holds.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_54_02">That was superbly done. Quiet and effective. Excellent work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_56_02">More C4. Not quite enough. Keep searching.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_cnc_01_03">Alesso is in town tonight. Going to use his concert as cover to hit Gensec at their arena.</string>
	 <string id="pln_al1_intro_01_03">Ah! Been some good gigs here. And Alesso&apos;s is the biggest one yet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_art_end_01_01">Great job! I&apos;ll start moving this stuff through our fences right away. Enjoy your payday, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_06_01">Well, at least it isn&apos;t nukes this time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_07_03">Get the safes out, gang. Yeah, I know it&apos;s over a hundred degrees, but get to it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_08_01">Gonna have to get through there. I&apos;m sending you C4.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_11_01">All right. Safes are in. We&apos;re getting out through the yard. Make sure the truck is there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_14_03">Get inside the truck! The chopper is going to airlift the whole damn thing out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_15_01">And....lift off! Outstanding work, crew!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_15_03">Flying like angels over...that ruin of a city. Great job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_19_01">Damn, place is wrecked. Still looking. Hang in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_as1_20_01">Got it! Construction yard, with a truck. Looks like the best way out of here, but you&apos;ll need C4 to bust that wall. Sending it now. Mind the safes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_cbf_01_01">I&apos;m sure you guys have tangled with Gensec before. They&apos;re the East Coast&apos;s premier provider of security solutions, if you believe their brochure. But, PR aside, these guys are serious. Today, we hit them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_end_02_01">That&apos;s a lot of cash! Nice job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_end_03b_01">I&apos;ve already got interested parties lined up to take the bullion. I&apos;ll also dig up what I can regarding this blueprint.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_07_02">Check the stores if you want some extra money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_08_02">Get some cross fire going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_10_02">Watch out! Bulldozer in the transport!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_12_03">Alright! The boat should be coming in soon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_14_01">It&apos;s open! Let&apos;s see what we got!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_15_02">Alright he&apos;s here! Get the loot over there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_gen_20_02">This is interesting. Military blueprints in a Gensec transport. I&apos;ll look into it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_har_01_01">This is going to be bumpy, so brace yourselves! Only one truck to deal with. As soon as the doors open, hit it hard!</string>
	 <string id="pln_at1_intro_05_02">Gensec in sight. Get those rigs moving. Go! Go! Go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_05_02">Firewalls are tripped. We&apos;re going to need a local port - one of the staff terminals. Check them out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_08_01">Connecting...</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_10_02">Wrong terminal. Try another.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_12_01">One of the staff terminals is holding a code. Find it, and start hacking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_15_02">Bunker down, gang. Hold the line until the time lock finishes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_16_02">There&apos;s an access ladder over the garage. Should be able to get to the roof there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_18_01">That should do it. Now start the time lock again. I hope that it worked.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_21_01">The cops messed up the time lock! Get it going again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_22_01">Come on! Get the time lock going again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_25_03">Get to the controls and turn the crane. You&apos;re going to like this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_28_01">Keep moving the crane. Can&apos;t drop it there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_31_01">Uhrm... maybe we should have hired Alex after all.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_31_02">Ouch! Careful with that crane, guys. This is a gem of a building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_32_02">Start hauling those bags to the vault, gang. Time to crack this place.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_37_01">There were spare drill bits in the piggy bank.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_38_01">Here we go. Doors open! Let&apos;s see how rich we are.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_53_02">When it comes to sourcing things like thumbs I operate a &quot;don&apos;t ask, don&apos;t tell&quot; policy. Now get to the security consoles.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_57_01">Got it! Now get back to the vault and enter the code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_61_01">Now get to the vault and assemble that rig.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bb1_67_03">Guys, the elevators are moving. Expect heat from there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_01_any_01">Alright, get to the house and find the address, be careful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_15_any_01">They&apos;re coming from the east, by the forest.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_16_any_01">They&apos;re coming from the west, by the construction site.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage1_brief_02">Yeah, they&apos;re ready for us judging by the number of lookouts... Looks like they have cameras too. Make sure you get close before you hit &apos;em.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_03_any_01">You can use the keycard you found.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_04_any_01">Good, now set up the connection.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_05_any_01">I&apos;m in, this might take a few...</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_08_any_03">I lost connection, I need you to get the power back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_13_any_01">Great, set off the flare so we can land!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_17_any_01">Hand me the reactor, quickly now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_20_any_02">This one seems to be malfunctioning, I&apos;ll be back to pick up another one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_intro_a_02">Ten point landing. Nice drop. You&apos;re a click away from his villa. Sneak across the airfield, get into the house. Find the engine, and bring it back here. I will do the rest.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bigoil_stage2_intro_a_03">Bull&apos;s-eye. Point Break-down: get inside the house, find the lab, get the engine, get back to this airfield, escape. Good luck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_02_any_01">OK guys, search the place. They have a safe somewhere, it&apos;s probably in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_03_any_01">Have you found the safe yet? The address is probably in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_03_any_03">Check the safe - find it. Fast!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_04_any_02">You found it. Now get it open and get that address.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_08_any_01">That might be useful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_12_any_01">They&apos;re coming from the west, by the construction site.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_13_any_01">They&apos;re coming from the east, by the forest.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_14_any_01">They&apos;re coming from the south by the factory.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo1_19_any_01">Nice! Get it to the van.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_27_any_01">I&apos;m in, might take a few to get the lab door open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_29_any_01">Get the power to the server back on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_29_any_02">They pulled the power, get it back on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_31_any_03">Keep it steady. I&apos;m connected.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_32_any_02">OK, the lab door is unlocked - open it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_35_any_03">Mark the landing - use the flare and the chopper will come in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_37_any_03">Helicopters landing. Load up the engine and hope it is the one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_39_any_01">Alright! He&apos;ll bring it over here so we can inspect it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_39_any_02">OK, he flies it to us. We will verify it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_40_any_01">We&apos;ve got the engine, I&apos;ll have my guy here inspect it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_43_any_01">Nice work guys! This seems to be the right one! You guys better head out of there ASAP. Use the plane keys you found.</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_48_any_02">OK, he is filling up that chopper now. Hold on guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_bo2_49_any_01">Yes! He&apos;s fueled up and heading back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_cash_cnc_03">Payday is this week which means the currency&apos;s here now. Which means we are too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_cash_cnc_07">Shame about all these banks we&apos;re hitting, but we all have expenses. Wolf&apos;s lifestyle isn&apos;t cheap. Go time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_cash_stage1_intro_a_02">OK folks, my guy stashed the thermal drill for the bank vault in the parking lot, so get that first. Watch for guards, keep an eye out for cameras - where there&apos;s cameras there&apos;s usually a security room... Money time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_depositbox_stage1_brief_02b">Take as much as we need, but get more if you feel lucky. Then bag it, and get to the escape van. Let&apos;s do this!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_depositbox_stage1_intro_a_02">OK people, my contact thoughtfully stashed the thermal drill you&apos;re going to need to crack the bank vault somewhere in the parking lot. Get it, then hit the bank vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_gold_a_intro_a_01">Branch bank job with a twist, and the twist is golden. Bars, that is. Let&apos;s do our thing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_gold_stage1_intro_a_03">OK, You&apos;re gonna need a thermal drill for this gig. My guy stashed it around the back of the bank. Get it and get to work on the vault.  Keep in mind there&apos;s security cameras and lots of civilians. Go win the gold, folks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_random_stage1_intro_a_03">Everyone, you know how it&apos;s done. My guy dropped the thermal drill in the parking lot, so grab that before you make your move inside. Some surveillance would be smart.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_random_stage1_intro_a_03b">Drill the vault when you are ready. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s here but I like our chances.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_regular_a_intro_a_04">Pretty sweet line on a bank - after a while they all start to look the same I bet. Let&apos;s do it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_regular_a_intro_a_06">Time for a bank job guys. I got a perfect one for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_05_any_03">Everyone get ready to make a little withdrawal now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_06_any_01">It&apos;s open! Bag the money!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_07_any_01">You might wanna look through some of the deposit boxes, could be something valuable.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_08_any_01">Alright, bring it to the van, it&apos;s right around the corner.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_10_any_01">Come on now, 1 more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_12_any_02">Well this looks like a gold mine now,doesn&apos; it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_15_any_03">OK the vault&apos;s open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_15_any_06">Vault&apos;s open! Bag the cash!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_20_any_01">They&apos;re coming into the bank! </string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_22_any_01">Street&apos;s clear for now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_23_any_03">Guys let&apos;s keep things moving along here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_32_any_02">They&apos;re in the bank!</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_34_any_04">Promising... Very promising...</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_35_any_01">Now it&apos;s just a matter of time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_35_any_02">...And yeah, there goes the alarm.</string>
	 <string id="pln_branchbank_stage1_35_any_03">Dammit. Now we go the painful way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_01_01">That was too damn close. Now, we don&apos;t have time to stand around, gang. Get him off that chair so we can get this over with.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_03_02">The mechanic said he wants you to bring him some kind of special tools from the workshop. Hurry up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_03_03">The workshop is where you&apos;ll find the tools. That&apos;s what the mechanic said.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_05_03">Just get the chrome skull the mechanic is asking for. Go inside the clubhouse and use the blowtorch he gave you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_06_02">The mechanic told you to go to the bunker and get the seat for him. </string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_12_01">Just keep driving straight!</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_12_02">That&apos;s it! Keep going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_13_01">There&apos;s the escape! Ride through the gate and you&apos;ll be safe!</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_13_03">That gate is your escape!</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_14_01">Umm... Okay then.</string>
	 <string id="pln_brn_14_02">I guess the man really wanted a soda...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_03_03">Don&apos;t forget the C4 in the limo. Man, cops are close. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_101_03">We can now redeem the Dentists&apos; contract. You can bounce, or treat Vegas to a Payday Gang party and loot the place.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_103_03">Come on, gang. Get to the locker room armory.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_104_01">Find those numbers, gang! We need all three to get into the armory.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_108_01">You bet on the right spot! There&apos;s the vault!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_10_01">104!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_110_01">Blast a hole in the floor of the Gambling Hall. That&apos;ll give us access to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_110_03">You need to get the C4 down in the Gambling Hall. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_115_02">BFD works hard, but drinks a lot of water. Make sure she has coolant. You can find water in the bathroom.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_121_02">Now get onto BFD and let the blimp carry you up, up and away. Or stay and grab more loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_126_02">Two!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_132_01">Eight</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_134_01">Strike! Gonna need to rob more banks if this is your luck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_134_02">Ouch! I hope that&apos;s not a sign of the luck you&apos;ll enjoy tonight.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_135_01">Ka-ching, gang! Maybe we can stop robbing banks and earn our payday on the slots.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_136_01">Whoa! Look at this place! Imagine all the loot we can boost from here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_137_01">These machines are for nickel-and-dime suckers. Don&apos;t waste your time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_137_03">These machines are small fry. We&apos;re here for a bigger prize.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_143_01">Exterior lounge. Nice for a cool drink..</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_14_01">154!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_150_01">Get the blueprints in the archives. They&apos;re somewhere in the employee only areas..</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_153_02">Its vent goes right to the Security Center.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_156_03">OK, first things first, look for the gear case.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_158_01">What the hell...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_163_03">If you want your beef rare, we&apos;ll just wipe its ass and lead it to your table.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_165_01">We got ice cream too. You like ice cream?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_166_01">We got rice. We got fries. We got mashed potato. We got grits.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_169_01">BFD needs more juice! Hook her up to the other socket. Keep it running.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_171_01">Screw the winch down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_172_03">You need to hook BFD up with the winch.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_17_01">Got it! I&apos;ll do a background check on this guy. Hang on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_23_02">Fill his glass. Once he downs that, well... he&apos;s going to lose interest in the slots. Follow him, and get his keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_25_02">That&apos;s his keycard. Grab it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_33_02">First number. Get the other two.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_42_03">Put the winch together where I marked, crew.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_43_01">Screw down the winch so that it&apos;ll be stable. Trust me, for what&apos;s coming, you need it secure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_44_02">Nice! Next, we&apos;re going to signal the blimp, and for something like that we need a big signal. A fireworks display! Find them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_46_03">Nice. Now light the fusepaper and...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_52_02">All right. Now this is why we brought the winch. Hook it to BFD, and it&apos;ll get the position right.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_55_03">Okay. It&apos;s thing is moving BFD, your thing is keeping it safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_58_02">All right. now throw that switch. Let&apos;s see what BFD can do!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_64_03">Just grab that loot and let&apos;s get it out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_66_02">Maybe your gear is at the pool. See if Micho left the gear there. Look for a guitar case.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_70_03">Reception will have the guest list, guys. Just head there, download it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_72_03">Don&apos;t forget to send me the list. Head to IT. Plug it in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_73_02">That&apos;s him. Got his name, SSN, last time he took a dump... Check the screen in IT. Find him. Says here he loves the slots, so maybe that will be where he is.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_78_02">Get him down! Tie him up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_90_02">The owner likely keeps his in his office. The pit boss will be near the main hall. Security head probably keeps his somewhere near the locker room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_92_01">Good job, that&apos;s the second number found. Just one more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_93_02">Their big vault takes a three digit code. This is one digit. Write it down. We&apos;ll need it later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_94_03">Good work. We&apos;ll need these three digits for the vault once we&apos;re through the Security Center.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ca1_intro_02_02">Arriving in style!</string>
	 <string id="pln_can_01_02">Guys, we can&apos;t risk leaving those thugs around. Deal with them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_can_04_01">Vlad needs you to secure those bags in the chimney.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_01_02">Keep it quiet til you get the cars. We can&apos;t afford to have cops shooting them up. I&apos;ll tell you when to plant the C4.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_01_05">Our buyers only want cars in great condition. That means you can&apos;t alert the cops. They won&apos;t care what they shoot up. So keep this a quiet one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_01_06">The market for these cars demands they are in perfect condition. Keep it quiet, and you&apos;ll keep the cops away. Which means no bullet holes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_05_02">Find that storage room, gang. The keys will be there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_06_03">And... it&apos;s locked. Damn! OK. Stay quiet. The manager must be around there somewhere. Take him hostage. He should be able to get us in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_07_03">I&apos;ve accessed the manager&apos;s file. He&apos;ll be wearing a suit.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_08_01">I can also see that he&apos;s balding. You copy that? Look for the old, balding guy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_08_02">Looks like the manager is losing a bit on top. Look for the balding guy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_09_02">Find the manager. He&apos;s wearing a black suit, going bald. Tie him up and see if he can help.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_10_02">He dropped a keycard. Probably for his office. Maybe something there will help.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_11_01">Use the manager&apos;s keycard to open his office.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_11_02">Use that keycard on the manager&apos;s office.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_12_03">They got a new IT guy on the books. If you can find his name and hack his pc, I should be able to open that door for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_13_03">Scope out the manager&apos;s office. You should be able to find who the IT guy is. Then you can hack his pc.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_21_02">Now jump into the car. Oh, and keep your head down - it&apos;s time to *blow* the joint.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_22_01">All of you need to be inside the dealership so I can blow up the C4!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_24_01">Damn it! Cops are on their way. Not much time now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_26_01">Almost there guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_26_03">Stand by, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_27_01">This better be the right one! Don&apos;t have much time now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_29_02">Ah hell. Wrong pc. Alarms are tripped. Cops are en-route. Not much time now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_31_03">Drive out of there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_33_01">Alright, just park the car in that container, and walk away!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_cnc_02_01">A rare job. Hit the Teuer dealership. Boost the new models.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_intro_01_02">Pull over here. Alright gang. Let&apos;s do this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ch1_intro_01_05">Pull over. This is it. Teuer Automotives.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_01_01">Okay, gang. Elephant gave you the briefing, so you know what we&apos;re after. We need to find the BCI headset and the computer software. You manage this, we&apos;ll make a lot of money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_03_01">Keep pushing forward, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_03_04">The front of the train, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_08_02">There it is! Get through the gate and secure both the BCI headset and the software.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_17_03">One minute, gang! One minute.</string>
	 <string id="pln_chw_20_02">Use the blowtorch to get through the gate!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_02_03">There&apos;s the pilot. Christ, that old soak can barely stand, let alone fly a plane. Escort him somewhere safe. I&apos;ll get the chopper on the way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_03_03">His blood must be 80% proof. Stay with him, help him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_05_02">OK, that&apos;s the chopper you can hear. Get our guy out there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_08_02">OK, chopper&apos;s pulling out. Hope you stowed some loot. It&apos;ll be back though. Try and find more of Vlad&apos;s coke.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_10_01">Did I just hear a present falling from a tree? Seems to be more of them stuck in there. Find &apos;em, crack &apos;em open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_11_02">The night&apos;s not so silent. Think I heard another present hit the ground. Find it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_14_03">The helicopter is in bound for the lumber yard, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_15_01">Chopper&apos;s headed for the crash site. Get ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_18_01">Great, the pilot&apos;s safe! Place a flare on the table outside the yard. Ignite it to signal the helicopter.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_18_03">OK, he should be out of harm&apos;s way. Place a flare on the table outside the yard. Set it off to signal the evac.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cp1_20_03">Flare is lit. Alright, he sees it. Chopper is in-bound.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_06_02">Left panel&apos;s activated. Now get another keycard, and let&apos;s get the second panel done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_100_03">An off-shore methlab? Clever. A methlab in a metal box? Not so clever...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_108_01">This is the Left Control Room for the Dock Gate. Use the Keycard here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_109_01">This gate will open automatically once the ship moves to Dock 3B.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_10_01">Guys, you gotta get into the dockyard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_113_01">This is one of the ship Control Rooms. Computers can be used for entering GPS targets, or you might find Moretta&apos;s comm frequency. There could also be a keycard or radio here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_115_01">Ship&apos;s in position! Going to hit it like Blackbeard! Zip-line could be a shortcut.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_118_01">Feeding the fish, eh?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_119_02">No one&apos;ll see that there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_120_02">Cops are at the powerboxes. Don&apos;t let them cut the juice.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_122_01">You guys have the bomb. No need to keep opening the containers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_124_02">No frequency here. Damn! Then the best bet is the office across the dock - check it out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_13_03">We need the ship&apos;s comm frequency. Likely on one of these terminals. Search them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_18_01">She stopped! Get on deck and and search the containers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_19_01">You already found the comm frequencies for the Moretta. No need to keep checking the computers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_20_02">Great job keeping it quiet. They don&apos;t suspect you, so the containers are unlocked. Have at it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_24_01">OK, place the C4 on the gate. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_24_03">Get that C4 on the dock gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_25_01">One in place.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_25_03">That&apos;s a start.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_27_03">Third placed. One more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_28_02">That&apos;s the C4 done. Clear the gate!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_29_02">Boom! </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_30_01">Well, we&apos;re not getting the Captain&apos;s cooperation now, but we still need that ship moved. Just hack the ship control terminal and make sure it stays on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_33_01">Good. I can get on with the work now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_34_03">Moretta is powering up. Let it move to its berth. Weapons free.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_42_01">And here&apos;s the second control room for the gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_43_02">These wagons might have something valuable in them. Maybe check them out? </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_45_01">Now use those keycards to open the gate. Doesn&apos;t matter which does which.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_46_01">Good. Now use the keycard on the panel in the other control room. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_52_01">That&apos;s it. Dock gate&apos;s opened. Now let&apos;s get the ship moving. We have the comm frequency. Just find the radio and patch me in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_52_02">That&apos;s it for the gate. Now we just got to get the ship moving. That frequency you found earlier will do it. Find a radio and let me talk to the Moretta</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_53_02">Guys, patch into the radio. Let me speak to the Moretta.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_61_02">Wonder what&apos;s in the case. Could be The Butcher&apos;s explosives. Have a look.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_66_01">They have no clue you are there. Now keep looking for those keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_67_01">They&apos;ve got no clue you&apos;re there. Keep looking for those keycards.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_69_03">Everything&apos;s quiet. Nice. Track down the comm frequency.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_70_02">You&apos;re keeping it quiet. Great. Now, the radio.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_82_01">Get the power back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_85_01">Don&apos;t let them get close to the power boxes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_86_03">Is it too much to ask that you keep the cops away from the power?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_88_01">Lucky that you found the manifest. Now we know which containers to drill!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_89_03">Get your drills on those containers, clowns.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_93_02">Chopper can&apos;t hang around forever, gang. Get there, get out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_93_03">You need to get back to the chopper. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr2_99_03">Great! Extra loot... Love it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_03_02">Nope, no vault. Move on, keep looking!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_05_01">Pick up that thermite, trust me, you&apos;re going to need it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_07_01">Damn, that vault is big. Need more water. Let the chopper refill. Hold tight!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_15_01">That&apos;s the wagon! Now plant the thermite on the top. We&apos;ll open that sucker up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_17_01">Let the thermite burn through. Won&apos;t take long to eat through.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_18_03">The wagons are all over the place. Could be loot in &apos;em. Might also be C4. If there is, grab it. You&apos;re gonna need it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_20_02">Best way in to this vault is water-cracking. We fill it with water, detonate it and, boom! Pressure busts the door open. Only way to insure we don&apos;t ignite those explosives.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_24_01">Chopper&apos;s on the scene! Bile, get that hose down to the gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_25_01">Keep an eye on that hose. Let it fill the vault. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_27_02">Cops pulled the hose. Get it back on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_30_01">There&apos;s gotta be explosives in one of the wagons. Search for them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_32_02">Get that C4 into the vault. And stand back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_34_02">They set up a roadblock. And heavy reinforcements are on the way too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_38_02">Sending a small plane to pick you up. Pilot can&apos;t land with those trees though. You gotta find a saw, clear a few and then mark the strip for him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_42_02">Plane&apos;s nearly there. Pop the flares and mark the strip.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_46_02">Chopper&apos;s right on top of you. Can you see it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_52_01">We&apos;re almost there, gang. It&apos;s filling up nicely! Just keep things going a little more. Once it&apos;s full, we rig it and enjoy the show!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_52_02">It&apos;s filling up fast, crew. Just keep it going. When it&apos;s full, plant the charge and enjoy the show.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_53_01">What&apos;s the hold-up?! Get that hose re-attached already!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_53_02">The hose won&apos;t fix itself. One of you clowns get it done!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_54_03">Pump&apos;s finished. That wagon is bloated and ready! Nicely done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_55_01">Wagon&apos;s not gonna crack itself open. Dip that C4 in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cr3_55_03">All that wagon is waiting for is a nice bit of C4. Get to it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_04_01">Green lights. Now let the time lock run down, and it&apos;ll open like a summer flower, and you bees can get busy with the honey.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_04_03">Great. Now just wait for that time lock to run down. So far this is textbook stuff. Be ready to bag the cash when it opens.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_06_03">Beautiful stacks of unmarked Benjamins. Just reward for an honest heister.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_08_03">Well, easy money for him. Put it out of your mind. Keep going, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_101_01">Hold them off while I find the best way out for you guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_102_02">They&apos;ve really opened the valve. The van can&apos;t wait forever. You need to book it, now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_103_03">There must be keycards around the place. They can help you get in quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_103_04">Control the crowd, guys. Keep the people down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_103_05">This place will have cameras. Be careful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_105_01">You need to get that cage set up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_107_02">Vault keycard. It gets half the job done. Swipe it in the reader, and then track down the second card.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_108_03">Job&apos;s half done. Find the second keycard and you can walk into the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_109_02">Protect the cage. These cops have no respect for your honest work and can take the bags.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_10_03">There&apos;s a thermal drill at the gas station. Fetch it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_112_02">Grab those bags, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_119_04">Thank you for your call. We look forward to hearing from you again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_124_01">Good afternoon. Roberts Bank. This is Randolph speaking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_159_01">Damn. Alright. Expect company, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_18_01">Get those bags with the cage pieces, and get them on the roof of the bank.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_18_03">The roof is the target for the plane, so the cage needs to be built there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_20_03">Carry the bags to the parking lot. Get the cage put together there. </string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_25_02">That&apos;s the balloon up. Great job.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_26_03">He missed! That asshole missed the cable. Hold the cops off, he&apos;s coming about to try again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_28_03">Our pilot has ditched his plane. That asshole! Time to adapt, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_32_03">Plane is en route. Just hold on, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_34_02">No more stealthing it, crew. But finish the job. Get that cash out of the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_34_03">The alarm sounded but it&apos;s too late for the vault. Get it empty, as fast as you can.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_36_01">Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Our boys are ready. Drop the skyhook cage. Over.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_36_03">Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Deploy the skyhook, our boys are waiting. Over.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_38_03">This isn&apos;t a request. Get your ass into position for a roof pick-up, or I&apos;ll see whole squadrons of F-16&apos;s scrambled in your direction!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_39_03">The pick-up is on its way. Not much margin for error here. Get to the roof.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_40_03">It&apos;s a piss poor location, but the pilot will collect the cage from the street. Be ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_42_02">This is Mortimer. At the bank. Your money is safe. Now, how can I help you?</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_49_02">Can any of you see the time lock codes. I can&apos;t stall them for long.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_49_03">Look around. The codes must be written somewhere. I can&apos;t stall them forever!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_51_03">It&apos;s got to be among these papers. Let&apos;s see. This is a B7040, that&apos;s not it. A FU5000. No, let me keep looking...</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_59_01">Remember to keep an eye on any bags in the cage. Cops can still snatch them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_63_01">Multiple hostiles entering by the street.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_68_01">It&apos;s the Feds! What the hell! They were waiting for us!</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_72_03">The Gensec truck&apos;s a bonus. A keycard in it would be a sweeter bonus.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_75_03">That&apos;s the heaviest truck the cops have got, so expect their best shot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_76_01">SWAT&apos;s have deployed to the adjacent roofs, so watch the crossfire.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_77_03">The cage is assembled. Great! Now start filling it with bags of Benjamins.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_78_01">Don&apos;t stand around. Start working on those deposit boxes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_81_03">It&apos;s about to get hot down there, gang. They&apos;re dropping grenades.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_89_01">Six bags. I&apos;m getting buttery thinking of all that extra loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_94_02">Keep an eye on all entry points, especially the ladders.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_98_01">There&apos;s an access hatch to the sewers over by the gas station. Go there, and get down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_cs1_brf_01">We got a bank here. Not a big branch but I&apos;ve learned the vault is temporarily holding stacks of cash in transit. Foreign exchange notes. Anyway, you know how to do it - your way. Sneak in silent, or unleash hell. Either way, I got a little idea for how to lift the money out of there. You&apos;ll see what I mean. I think you&apos;ll like it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_01_02">You&apos;re cats hiding from dogs. Stupid, rich ones. </string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_03_03">Hey, you&apos;re supposed to be hacking those routers, remember?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_04_03">There&apos;s a router box right near you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_09_02">That&apos;s one security box taken care of.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_102_01">Halfway there guys, keep going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_104_03">Chopper is back and waiting for more bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_105_01">One more bag, then you get leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_107_01">.. or stay and bag a little more. Up to you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_109_02">What&apos;re you waiting for?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_109_06">Chop-chop. To the chopper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_10_01">All right, system has been hacked.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_111_03">Keep it quite. Don&apos;t get spotted.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_113_02">Hey, great. You found the keycard ahead of schedule.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_114_01">You got the code wrong guys! System is locked for 30 seconds.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_114_03">You&apos;re locked out. The system is gonna take 30 seconds to reset.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_13_03">Found a laptop for you guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_14_01">There&apos;s the second one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_15_02">That&apos;s all of them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_15_03">Last one is there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_17_02">Check the cafeteria for a computer. Bring me a cappuccino while you&apos;re at it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_18_03">I think there&apos;s something in the Jade Room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_22_01">You&apos;ll probably find a computer in Administration.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_22_02">Have a look in the Admin Office, there&apos;s bound to be a PC there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_23_03">Public Relations would be a good place to search for computers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_24_03">There&apos;s something glowing in the Velvet Room but it&apos;s not the ghost of Elvis. More likely a laptop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_26_03">Hey guys, you should run by the Tiffany Room, I just saw a PC in the security feed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_27_03">Might want to check the contruction site for a computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_30_02">The Amber room looks like it has a laptop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_34_01">Perfect, that&apos;s all of them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_35_03">Ralph Garnet has the last piece of the puzzle. Find him and take his keycard. He&apos;s around there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_36_01">Keep looking for Ralph.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_37_01">Don&apos;t loose that keycard, you&apos;re gonna need it later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_39_02">Don&apos;t get the code wrong or the alarm will go off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_40_02">That vault is just waiting to be emptied guys. Use the keycard, then enter the code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_40_04">The vault isn&apos;t going anywhere. It&apos;s waiting for tha keycard and code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_42_03">Watch the glass. Cut through it instead of smashing or the alarm will go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_45_03">Another vault. Didn&apos;t expect that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_47_03">Try to get that second vault open if you can.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_49_03">How are you coming along?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_49_04">Keep working guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_50_03">Keep going. Good job so far.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_53_02">Time to make a hasty retreat guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_54_02">Back to the platform where you came in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_55_03">It&apos;s time to leave guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_60_01">That was the wrong sequence, now the system is locked unless you find the master code!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_63_01">Cop choppers are inbound!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_63_02">Blues are on the way in choppers so keep your eyes open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_64_03">Keep looking for those router boxes, I&apos;m working on a plan B.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_66_03">Just one more to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_69_08">Drop any cop that gets close!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_70_03">No too long now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_71_03">There we go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_73_03">Ralph&apos;s got to be hiding somewhere. Find him and get that card!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_75_02">You need to find the CFO. He&apos;s got the master code. You *need* the master code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_75_03">You still need to find the master code!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_78_03">Chopper is inbound. Stand by!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_79_03">I&apos;ll crack this guy like an egg and have that code for you shortly.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_80_01">Swipe Ralph&apos;s card before entering the code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_92_02">You get that? The code is...</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_92_07">Forget the code? It&apos;s...</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_96_01">Another vault?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_96_02">A second vault?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_96_03">More than one vault? Didnt&apos; see that one coming.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_97_02">Well now, it&apos;s probably worth a hell of a lot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_97_03">It&apos;s gotta be worth a lot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dah_end_loud_03">It was loud, but it was succesful. Outstanding people.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_03_01">What? We didn&apos;t lay a damn thing. How is that possible?</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_03_03">Bang on target, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_04_02">Ok guys, Get after that gold!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_06_02">The truck is in the slaughterhouse. There&apos;s C4 stashed in those bins. Grab it and bust in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_07_03">C4 is in the bins, crew. Blast the door with it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_09_03">Crew, bring it down. Perhaps a little force will do it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_11_03">C4 those truck doors, gang. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_12_03">Crack that safe, guys. Get that gold out of the firezone.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_14_01">Nice. Out in the yard, I have a container ready to stash the gold. Number 61. Get it there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_15_02">Get the gold out to container 61, crew.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_17_01">Remember: set fire to the tires. Get gas all over them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_19_01">Now the helicopter won&apos;t see where we load the containers. </string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_20_01">Container 12. Lay a nice trap to cover our escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_20_02">Dump some gas in container 12. It&apos;ll cover our escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_22_01">Gang, we need that firetrap by our escape. Use the crane controls.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_24_02">Put the container with the gold on that truck. Use the crane!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_24_03">Gotta get the container with the gold loaded on the truck. The crane can do it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_26_01">Gang, stop standing around, and get to the escape point. Follow the blue containers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_28_01">Gang, ignite the trap!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_31_03">We&apos;ll have this melted down and on the market before the Murkies pay out their early retirements on this job.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_33_01">Swats are spreading all over the roof. Look up guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_34_03">Police chopper is over you. We can&apos;t let them see which container we use.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_35_01">OK, remember the plan. Extract the gold, move the gold, set the smoke screen, set the trap, escape. Lets go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_36_03">Now, lay a fire trap in container 12. Dump some gas in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_38_03">Guys, out of the container! It&apos;s not going anywhere with you inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_41_01">Great. All right, now put that gas down in the container. We&apos;ll light it later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_dn1_intro_01_01"> ...and also on the 45 going south, there&apos;s been a major accident that&apos;s clogging the entire freeway.  It&apos;s like a war zone out there this morning so you better take a scenic route.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_03_01">Guys, find the Murkywater trains.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_07_02">Look for the EMP parts. That&apos;s top priority.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_07_03">Gang, are you looking for the EMP parts?</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_08_02">What the hell? Elephant&apos;s sources didn&apos;t mention an additional security door...</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_09_01">... looks like we&apos;re going to need a keycard to get past this...</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_11_01">Gang, without a keycard we&apos;re not getting past that door. Look for it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_11_04">You really need to find a keycard to get that door open. Come on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_16_03">We still need to find a blowtorch, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_17_02">Great, you actually found a blowtorch. Head back to the train and get through that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_18_03">Get back to the security door and get it open using the blowtorch.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_22_01">You found thermite? Excellent! Head back to the steel gate and melt those bars.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_22_02">Great, you found some thermite. Now we can melt our way through that steel gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_25_01">Murkywater like their technology, so they should have some kind of mobile command center nearby. See what you can find.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_29_01">Maybe that equipment will come in handy later, so hold on to it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_29_02">Sure, why not? We might find use for it later.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_32_01">Gang, we still need to get the EMP.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_33_03">Great job! Head over to the escape area and drop off the EMP bomb.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_34_03">Secure the EMP over by the escape area. Better to be safe than sorry.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_35_02">Excellent, we got the EMP secured. I won&apos;t blame you if you want to get some extra loot before you escape. Up to you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_35_03">With the EMP secured, there is some time to kill before the escape vehicle arrives.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_37_01">Listen up, gang. Twitch is coming in with the van. He will come from the upper bridge side.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_38_01">Hey, these vents should be perfect if you need hide a body or transfer loot through.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_39_01">If you happen to drop one of the guards, you should be able to hide the body under the train so it doesn&apos;t get detected.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_40_01">Damn, are those drones? We&apos;re really living in the future, aren&apos;t we? They seem to have a camera so stay out of sight.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_40_02">Drones with cameras, really? Murkywater are stepping up their game. Be careful that you don&apos;t get spotted.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_46_01">Gang, I want a sweep of the whole area. That means checking all corners of the train yard. Don&apos;t leave any stone unturned.</string>
	 <string id="pln_drk_46_03">There&apos;s four of you, guys. Spread out if needed and check all corners of the train yard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_02_01">Alright. You&apos;re in. Now hunt around. There&apos;s gotta be a clue about which truck is carrying the voting machines to Washington. Search containers, check computers - anything you can to figure out the right truck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_02_03">OK, now look around. We need to tag the truck headed for Washington. Look around for clues. Containers, terminals, any records. Find the right one, and tag it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_03_01">Tracker placed. Signal coming through. Now haul ass, and let&apos;s hope we&apos;re chasing Elephant&apos;s machines.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_03_02">Getting a nice clear signal. Time to leave, guys. I hope you tagged the right truck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_04_02">Crap! You were seen, and the convoy is rolling out. We need another way to find our truck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_04_03">The trucks are on the move. Someone saw you! OK, time for another plan.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_07_03">The first database is downloaded. If we get the second, it&apos;ll increase our chances of tracking the right truck. But it&apos;s your call.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_12_02">Try and keep the cops from hitting those circuit breakers. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_13_03">Receiving the data now. It should be enough for me to find where the right truck is headed. Just keep it coming.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_15_03">Those containers have cargo. That might help you eliminate the wrong trucks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_16_01">One of these trucks is the one we want. When you&apos;ve finished searching for clues, get the tag on the truck you think is our target. You get one chance, so make sure you&apos;re certain.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_end_c_02">Well, if you had to go loud, best to do it properly, and that was some outstanding action. You got the whole database. Sifting through the info now...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_intro_a_02">Pier 39. Find the truck that has the voting machines. It will be bound for Washington. Figure out which one it is, slap on the tracker and get the hell out. Keep it quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed1_intro_a_03">The trucks are right over the other side of the wharf. Find the right one, get the tracker on and get out. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_01_any_01">It&apos;s open, take our stuff back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_02_02">Alright, now that you&apos;re in, let&apos;s go after the machines. Chances are they are sealed in crates, so keep an eye open for them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_03_02">You should be looking for the shipping crates. Chances are they hold the machines.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_06_03">Great! You found a machine. Alright, get the hack started, and let it finish.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_09_02">There&apos;s the alarm. Cops are en route. Keep hacking those machines. I&apos;ll think of a new plan.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_11_03">Hack those machines, guys. Each corrupt machine will pile more pressure on Schwartz.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_13_03">You need to find where the camera footage is kept. Move it, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_20_01">There&apos;s your bonus. Get it to the van. You guys deserve it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed2_end_b_02">Great work! The hacked machines have made it look like the Mayor&apos;s people were behind this. Even if an enquiry exonerates her, the papers are hurling so many buckets of shit at the Mayor that she&apos;s finished. And The Elephant? Well, his man is picking out new furniture for City Hall. Great work, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_02_02">Case the place before lighting things up. Maybe there&apos;s a better way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_04_02">That looks like the server we&apos;re after. Get that scrambler going. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_05_02">Looks like the scrambler software just crashed. Some shitty code. Start it back up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_08_02">OK, the data is scrambled! It&apos;ll seem like just a normal data failure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_09_01">Now, blast that wall open! The explosion will trash the voting machines.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_10_01">Boom! The wall is history. Should have taken a few machines down with it too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_13_01">Come on, guys - time to grab the cash.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_20_02">That&apos;ll keep nosy bastards from spying on our business. Good.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_23_01">So far, so good, clowns.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_23_06">Still good. Still good.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_99_01">C&apos;mon guys, lets change the change!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ed3_end_a_02">They should teach this little bit of political engineering for years to come. Outstanding, gang. Outstanding!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_03_to_departure">Secure as much loot as you can. The escape vehicle is leaving in three minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_04_to_arrival">Four minutes left, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_09_to_arrival">The escape will be there in nine minutes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_30secs_to_arrival_heli">The chopper touches ground in 30 seconds. Get ready to move!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_30secs_to_departure_van">30 seconds left. Get in the van or you&apos;ll be left behind.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_cafe_warn_timelimit_subway_01">You won&apos;t have much time to escape, so be ready to move towards the subway station.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_overpass_more_snipers_02">The cops are deploying snipers in the area, don&apos;t walk into their sights.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_park_marksmen_rooftop_01">SWATs are assuming positions on a nearby rooftop, watch out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_requirement_02_bags">Remember guys, we need at least two bags to escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_requirement_03_bags">Remember guys, we need three bags to escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_requirement_06_bags">Remember guys, we need six bags to escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_requirement_08_bags">Remember guys, we need eight bags to escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_lookout_sniper_01">One of you should keep an eye out for those snipers at all times!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_more_snipers_deployed_01">More snipers are coming in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_more_snipers_deployed_02">Snipers are inbound!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_more_snipers_deployed_03">A sniper team is moving in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_swats_deployed_01">The cops are realizing those snipers wont be enough to take you down. They&apos;re prepairing to send in SWATs. Get ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_street_swats_deployed_03">Heads up, SWATs are moving in to try to finish this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_esc_warn_timelimit_heli">You&apos;ll have to move fast when the chopper arrives. It can&apos;t stay long with this amount of heat.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_07_any_03">I get why the Elephant wants this. It is tons of gold in this deal!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_07_any_06">Oh, my! Seems like the good senator did the deal and partied at the same time - looks like a arms-gold-coke deal.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_09_any_01">What a flat! These arms deals sure are a nice addition to his senator pay.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_15_any_01">Yes, that is the epicenter - right there. I wonder what kind of treasure that house can hold. OK, on with our heist here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ff3_17_any_01">Ah, that is the vault guys. That door, we can&apos;t get through it this time. But the gold... The gold on the other side! Well, we got to leave it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_end_a_01b">OK we&apos;re good to go. I&apos;ll get you guys cleared to the safe house. Their arsenal is gone. Their soldiers toothless.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage1_end_b_01">You dont let me down. Hector will be proud of this work. We are in business for real.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_05_any_01">Should be a higher security type of door, look for a Gensec logo.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_28_any_01">Awesome job gang! Last step - you need to dismantle the server and bring it to the car.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_29_any_01">Alright, you got it. Let&apos;s get out of here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_end_a_03">Good work, crew. Now if Hector knew we just hit the FBI for the info he might worry a bit. But what Hector doesn&apos;t know won&apos;t hurt him. Let&apos;s go banking, shall we?</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage2_intro_a_03">OK folks. Going straight to the source. Inside that place is the info we need - and way more law than we want to be close to. Find their server room and get the info on the bank. I&apos;ll do the rest.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_13_any_01">The surveillance guard triggered the alarm.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_end_a_01">Hector got the footage. I&apos;m told he laughed long and hard. And now the FBI looks impossibly incompetent, which takes a lot of heat off of us. Great work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_firestarter_stage3_end_a_04">Mendoza&apos;s not going to like that outcome. But we should. Well done. Go get paid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_01b_02">Go quiet and keep your eyes open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_01b_03">Careful now. I hope you didn&apos;t bring your squeaky shoes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_02_01">There should be a laptop with information about where the cash is hidden. We got the password from Charon so all you gotta do is find the thing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_03_01">Find that laptop, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_03_03">You find that laptop yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_03_06">Guys, the laptop. Did you find it yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_03_07">The laptop must be there somewhere. Find it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_05_03">Enter the password and access the files.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_06_02">Looks like a list of where the money is hidden. It&apos;s all over the yacht.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_07_01">Big ones and Benjamins. Beautiful!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_09_02">You got the second stash. Keep looking, two more!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_11_03">That&apos;s all of the cash!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_12_02">If you throw the loot bags into the sea, you can pick them up when it&apos;s time to leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_14_02">Either secure the bags in the motorboat, or chuck them in the sea. We can pick them up as we leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_17_01">Ok, connect me to the laptop, this should only take a moment.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_20_02">If you overheat the system it&apos;ll do a soft reboot, giving you access to the controls. Then you can get the server.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_20_03">You&apos;ll need to induce a soft reboot by overheating the system. That&apos;ll get you access to the controls so you can grab the server.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_24_01">Great, now I should be able to override the main panel.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_25_02">Check two overrides, two more to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_26_02">One more should do it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_27_02">Ok, we got it. Can&apos;t wait to extract those passwords!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_29_01">You cleaned it out. Time to leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_end_01">Great job, gang - you really screwed McKendrick over this time. He won&apos;t be happy when he finds out all that money&apos;s gone.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_intro_01">Okay, pirates - board the ship and get the loot. And keep it quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fish_intro_02">Be careful now, don&apos;t let the guards see you. And find that cash.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_02_03">Break the glass and bag those jewels. Remember all the extra stuff around the store.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_07_01">Alright guys, get the bags to the van!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_07_03">The van is back. Get the bags to it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_12_01">Remember, we need three bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_12_03">We need to get three bags with us for this one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_13_02">Guys, six bags, that&apos;s what we need.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_14_01">Remember, we need eight bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_14_02">Guys, eight bags, that&apos;s what we need.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_cbf_01_01">Theres a jewelry store downtown, fairly simple target. But be ready for the heat if the alarm goes off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_cbf_01_02">The new jewelry store down town is loaded with jewels. Those could be ours. You want to pay them a visit?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fj1_cnc_01_01">Another jewelry store that needs a visit. You guys up for it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_01_02">This is it, gang. Chavez&apos; place.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_03_02">Don&apos;t just stand around, get in there. </string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_03_03">The bouncer will get suspicious if you don&apos;t walk in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_03_08">Guys, don&apos;t keep them waiting. Get in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_04_03">Get in there and get the deal started.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_05_02">Don&apos;t raise suspicion. Do what they tell you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_05_03">Stop walking around and go inside the room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_06_01">Keep your eyes peeled. Something&apos;s up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_06_02">I&apos;ve got a bad feeling about this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_07_02">Okay, time for our move. Get the masks on and let&apos;s go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_11_02">Hey now, that&apos;s a big toothbrush... Can I have it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_13_03">That was intense, but you did what was needed. Pick up the key and head back to the panic room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_15_03">We still need the key from Chavez to get through that door. Find him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_16_03">Okay, we&apos;ll need to use the saws to cut the room free from the floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_18_01">Make sure those saws keep running. If one of them jams, get it fixed immediately. We can&apos;t stick around forever.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_19_01">You guys keeping an eye on the saws? They&apos;re all running?</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_19_02">Remember to keep the saws running. They tend to jam.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_19_03">Are the saws still running? </string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_20_01">The saws have done their part, excellent.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_21_01">Okay, gang, cops are here - as expected. It&apos;s easier to take them out on street level before they actually storm the building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_21_02">The police are here. They&apos;ll storm the building if they get the chance, so maybe stop them before they can.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_22_01">Okay, time for the next step in our plan - the C4 from Bile. Wait, let me patch him in. &quot;Bile, you there? We need the C4. How long?&quot;</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_22_03">That&apos;s it, guys, we&apos;re doing it. Give me a sec. &quot;Hey, Bile, it&apos;s time for the C4. How fast can you be here?&quot;</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_24_01">Good job, gang. With the snipers gone, Bile will be able to make the drop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_28_02">Great. Now we need some more on the fifth floor and then some on the roof.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_29_01">Excellent. The fifth floor is all that&apos;s left.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_34_02">Good. Fifth floor is done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_35_01">That&apos;s it, gang. Fourth floor complete.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_35_03">Fourth floor is done. Good.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_37_02">Stand clear from the blast radius, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_39_02">That&apos;s one hell of a hole! It&apos;s perfect!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_40_03">Keep fighting, guys! Bile is coming back any minute!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_41_02">Bile! Time to return and pick up the cargo. How soon can you be back?</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_42_02">Okay, gang, here they come! Find a good position to defend yourselves! We&apos;re almost done!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_43_01">OK, the winch is secured. Let&apos;s pull this package out of here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_43_03">The magnet is in place. Time to pull it out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_48_02">Run! Just run!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_49_03">Faster guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_flt_50_01">Who the hell can do what we just did? No one! This will go down in history, just like I said.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fourstores_stage1_intro_a_01">OK, we&apos;re coming up on Vlad&apos;s old stomping grounds. Go in there and get Vlad his money. Send a message to these people that no one is safe from crazy Vlad. Roll out before the cops shut you down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_02_any_01">OK, you&apos;re inside. Find the paintings with the red stickers on them, we want at least four.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_04_any_02">OK we can&apos;t screw around anymore. Just get me access to the computer in the surveillance room, I&apos;ll deal with it remotely.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_08_any_02">Have you checked any of the vertical options? There&apos;s got to be access to the interior up there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_09_any_01">Great, we need at least 3 more, get it to the van. It&apos;s in the parking lot next to the gallery.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_10_any_01">That&apos;s half, we need 2 more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_15_any_02">SWAT units are moving into the building, get ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage1_brief_01b">You need to take the marked paintings to the senator&apos;s apartment. They&apos;ll have cameras installed in them. Eyes on the inside will make your job easier, trust me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_01_any_01">OK people, get the phone. Let&apos;s get this trade out of the way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_02_any_01">Someone pick up the phone...</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_05_any_02">OK, now let&apos;s just hope they call you fast.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_06_any_01">There it is, get the phone.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_06_any_03">OK, that&apos;s them calling.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_07_any_01">OK folks, everyone into the train.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_09_any_01">OK now remember, one bag of cash for every painting. </string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_10_any_01">OK good, now there is a van waiting for you on the other side of that building. Go through, load up the car, and we&apos;re done for the day.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_10_any_02">We&apos;re done here, there&apos;s a van waiting on the other side of the building. Go on through, load the car up, and we&apos;re done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_13_any_02">Dammit! SWAT ambush. I didn&apos;t see it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_18_any_03">Good move.. that&apos;s bound to lead to the warehouse.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_end_a_01">The senator&apos;s man just told me they got the paintings. They&apos;re thrilled with the trade. Now they&apos;re right where we want &apos;em, thanks to your good work. Hopefully you got some of that money too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage2_end_b_01b">I&apos;ll keep this for the payday - that plus the gold from the senator&apos;s apartment should load your safe house vault nicely. Great work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_13_any_01">Thats all of them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_15_any_01">Connect the devices to the station on the roof.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_17_any_01">OK! We&apos;re gold. I think I got everything we need. You should be able to access his desktop computer now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_18_any_01">It&apos;s located in his office.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_20_any_01">There&apos;s just a little problem... I don&apos;t actually know where the vault is, physically.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_27_any_01">If you want to go for more, use his desktop PC, it should open the vault up for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_29_any_01">We have to shut them off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_36_any_01">It&apos;ll take some time, lots of data to up and a small pipe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_42_any_01">Look for a circuit breaker to get the power back up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_47_any_02">Keep them the hell away from the circuit breaker, you hear me?</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_48_any_02">OK, to make things a little more interesting I&apos;m sending this feed live to all the big media outlets while we upload. Lots of coverage.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_brief_01b">You can tap the feed from the roof of the building, sorry we couldn&apos;t do better. Get into his hidden vault, take the gold, and leave a little coke there to finish the frame job.</string>
	 <string id="pln_framing_stage3_end_a_01">Drugs planted, senator framed. Bad guys 1, Politicians 0. Well done, very smooth operation in there. The Elephant will love this outcome.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_02_02">Let&apos;s find the head of security. He should have what you need to get in - USB stick with security codes. He&apos;ll be wearing a green jacket.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_03_01">We need the USB stick from the head of security.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_03_03">The head of security will have that USB stick.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_08_01">What... guys, protect the computer! </string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_08_02">They interrupted the computer. You gotta protect it, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_08_03">The computer got interrupted. You have to defend it better!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_11_02">Ok, that should do it. Now start the computer again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_15_03">There must be a switch or something that opens up the rest of the house. Try to find it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_16_01">Ok guys, that did it! The house is open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_17_01">Wait... we can&apos;t get into the lobby or Sosa&apos;s office. It must run on a separate system.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_18_02">I&apos;m thinking here. I don&apos;t know how we&apos;re gonna get in...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_20_02">Hmm... she&apos;s right, gang. Let&apos;s destroy some of his stuff and see if we can provoke him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_21_03">Let&apos;s burn his paintings. Gather them in a pile first.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_22_02">That&apos;s a spot as good as any. Pile &apos;em up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_27_01">Hey Bile, you there? We got some cars that need picking up and dropping off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_27_02">Bile? I need you to fly in and move some cars for me.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_27_03">Bile? I got an airlift job for you. A grab and drop, you could say.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_28_01">Not just guards, but turrets too! This guy takes security seriously!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_29_03">Ok gang, now we&apos;re gonna loot Ernesto&apos;s floor safe. I bet it&apos;s full of wonderful things. There are some winches stashed near the place where you entered the property - go get them and hook them up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_31_02">Come on, get those winches hooked up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_31_03">Hook the winches up to the floor!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_33_02">The winch seems to have jammed. Get it up and running again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_34_02">Don&apos;t forget to get that winch running again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_35_01">Ok, protect them now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_38_02">That&apos;s all of it, every single dime! Now it&apos;s time to go home!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_42_02">There he is. Looks like he&apos;s at the back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_43_02">Hey, there he is. Looks like he&apos;s by the pools.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_44_01">That&apos;s the head of security. He seems to be at the stairs.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_44_03">That&apos;s the head of security. He&apos;s by the stairs.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_48_03">The beard is green but not long.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_48_05">Montezuma wants three oranges for breakfast.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_49_07">Boss, there&apos;s something strange with this coke. You gotta see it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_51_01">Well done, nice and quiet. Secure everything if you can, but we need at least a few bags to make this worthwhile. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_51_02">Good. Get as much loot as you can, but at least a few bags.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_52_01">You could get a zipline up to move the bags.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_52_02">If you want to move the bags faster, you can set up a zipline.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_53_03">Don&apos;t forget to get the bags out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_54_01">Hey guys, more Sosa thugs are on their way to the mansion! They&apos;ll be here any minute, I hope you don&apos;t have bodies lying around in the open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_55_03">Listen, the guards inside the house are likely to have pagers. Be careful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fri_intro_03">You could say Ernesto Sosa is lucky to have this beautiful house in Miami Beach. But his luck is about to change...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_02_any_01">We ain&apos;t got all night boys, hurry up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_03_any_01">This is the correct hangar, bag those guns and get ready bring them back up to van.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_04_any_01">Judging by the amount of bodies, this is the gear we are after.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_05_any_01">Keep and eye on that control tower guys, I thought I saw some movement up there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_05_any_02">Movement in the control tower, keep watching those windows.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_08_any_01">Almost there now, just a few more bags and we should have enough.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs1_12_any_01">Good thinking! Use that fire to destroy the weapons.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_01_any_02">This is an FBI auxiliary office. The hornet&apos;s nest. For the love of God stay quiet. First thing, get inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_03_any_02">OK, good. Let&apos;s find that server room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_05_any_03">Alarm on that door guys. We need to take care of that first.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_06_any_02">Smooth - thats the door and the alarm is off. Get in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_06_any_03">Door - check. Alarm off - check. Get in there boys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_08_any_01">I need access to their systems. I&apos;ve marked out a computer for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_15_any_01">Hurry ! Hurry! Get the next door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_15_any_03">OK, another door! FBI is on us - hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_16_any_03">Just get the server clear of its housing and take it to the van. </string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_17_any_03">FBI sure knows security. Get that barrier open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_18_any_01">It&apos;s open, get the server!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_19_any_03">FBI is still sleeping. Keep this up boys. Carry that loot out of there...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_21_any_02">Shit - what kinda move is that! Go in! Go guns blazing, we gotta get inside!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_23_any_01">There goes the alarm. Let&apos;s go straight for the server room door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_23_any_02">Alarm guys. Hit the server room door right away.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_23_any_03">Shit, Feds will be here shortly. Hit the server room door now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_24_any_03">FBI spotted us, guys. Hit that door hard!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_25_any_01">Damn it! We were so close!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_25_any_02">Close, close, close. OK, go full force guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_26_any_01">Damn it! We almost did it! Just get it to the van.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs2_28_any_03">Ha! Taking it back. This is our old loot, isn&apos;t it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_02_any_01">Holy shit! Looks like they&apos;ve electrified the vault! Get to the generator on the roof and shut it off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_02_any_02">Goddamn cartel! They electrified the goddamn vault. Get to the generator on the roof and shut it off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_04_any_02">Hector wants this recorded. Don&apos;t ask - I didn&apos;t.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_06_any_02">While it&apos;s burning I&apos;d start getting some of those deposit boxes open. You didn&apos;t think we were just gonna leave empty handed, right?</string>
	 <string id="pln_fs3_07_any_01">OK, enough money making, take the recording and make a run for it, unless you wanna hang around for more loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_02_01">OK. Find the bank manager.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_04_05">The manager will likely be around the back. His type don&apos;t spend much time with the plebs. Black suit, balding.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_04_07">The manager is our target. Middle-aged creep with a bald spot. Get his keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_04_08">Keep an eye open for the manager. Black suited creep, losing a bit up top, mid 40&apos;s. Get his keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_05_02">Great. Now use the card to get inside the server room. Second floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_06_02">We need to deal with the metal detectors. Best way: simply kill the power. There are electricity boxes around.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_08_03">That&apos;s the metal detectors dealt with. Great.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_13_01">All right, let&apos;s see what we got.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_13_03">Okay, searching...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_13_04">Come on, let me see what you got...</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_14_08">Credit score, eight-fifty! But no codes. Keep looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_15_01">Aaand here we go: The code is... 1138.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_17_01">Enter the code.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_19_03">The two keycards will be around here somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_19_05">Search the offices, desks - those keycards are around there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_19_07">Those keycards can&apos;t have vanished. They&apos;re there somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_21_01">Use one of those cards on the security terminal. Then, use the second keycard on the keypanel by the vault door. There&apos;s a short window, so don&apos;t shilly-shally.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_23_01">Too slow, try again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_24_02">And...open sesame!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_25_01">There it is. Neatly stacked. Well, you&apos;re robbers, ain&apos;t you? Get robbing!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_26_03">Gang, the money&apos;s there, just waiting for you. Get at it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_27_01">Once you&apos;ve got your fill, throw the bags through that vent by the elevators. Don&apos;t worry. You&apos;ll see &apos;em again soon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_28_02">You need to drop those bags in the vent.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_30_03">Meet up with the Insider. She&apos;ll get you out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_31_01">Stay low and quiet. Offices are never empty.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_31_02">Probably people working here. Keep an eye out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_33_01">All right, there&apos;s the truck and there&apos;s our bags. Stash the loot into the truck, quick!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_35_02">That&apos;s the alarm - time for plan B. Do the countdown.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_37_03">The copy machine in the server room has the Plan B equipment. Grab it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_37_04">Go pick up the drill and thermite. It&apos;s hidden inside the copy machine.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_38_01">There&apos;s one more can of thermite in the copy machine but someone else needs to carry that one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_40_02">All right. Get that drill set up on the gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_44_01">Access the computer I have marked out for you. Use it to drop the magnetic seal.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_53_03">Ahhhh, look at all that cash. Okay, fill your bags, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_54_01">Come on, we&apos;re almost done. Get the money!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_55_03">Cops are about to open the door. Give them a Payday welcome!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_57_01">OK, escape plan: Go up to the server room, blow up the wall and escape through the basement of the neighboring building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_57_02">Right, here&apos;s our way out. Get back upstairs, and C4 the wall into the adjoining building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_59_01">Head upstairs to the office corridors!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_60_03">Blow a hole in the wall and run!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_61_02">We&apos;re blasting out the back door. Get C4 on that wall!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_62_02">Now, get through there! That&apos;s the way out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_64_03">We&apos;re almost done. Get down to the garage, secure that loot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_66_03">Use the keycard to enter the server room on the second floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_69_01">You&apos;ve disabled all cameras in the vault area. They&apos;re blind back there now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_fwb_70_03">And... The bank is dark to us. Good work, crew. </string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_01_02">Alright, get in there and find the target.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_02_01">Keep moving along the bridge until you reach the prison transports.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_04_02">Go find those transports.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_04_03">Get to the prison transports.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_04_08">Get to the trucks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_05_02">Whoa, another explosion! Look out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_06_03">You gotta saw the trucks open to find out which one he&apos;s in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_07_02">Saw those trucks open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_08_01">Ok, first transport is open - check it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_08_02">That&apos;s the first one opened - have a look inside!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_08_03">One truck opened! Check inside!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_09_02">That&apos;s the second one opened - have a look inside!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_09_03">Second truck opened! Check it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_10_01">Third transport is open - check inside!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_10_02">Check the third transport, it&apos;s opened now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_15_02">Come on! Get him to the tower!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_15_04">The tower! Come on, get him up there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_15_05">Get the prisoner up that tower!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_15_08">Come on guys, get the prisoner to the tower!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_16_01">Keep him moving!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_16_02">Come on, don&apos;t leave the prisoner behind!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_19_03">Ok, you&apos;re at the top? Help him buckle up and release the balloon. The plane will be there any minute.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_20_02">Release the balloon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_21_01">Oh crap, is that an attack helicopter?</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_22_03">Plane is on its way in to pick the goods up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_23_01">You heard that? The pickup will take place in a couple of minutes. Until then - hold the fort!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_23_03">Two minutes to pickup. Hold on guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_24_01">Another attack helicopter! Careful guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_24_02">Oh no, another attack helicopter!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_24_03">That&apos;s another attack helicopter guys! Stay sharp!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_25_01">Where&apos;s that plane? Report status!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_26_01">30 seconds to pickup, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_29_01">Time to get out of here. Leave the tower and move further along the bridge.</string>
	 <string id="pln_glc_33_03">Ok, you&apos;re gonna have to raise the balloon again, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_01_02">When you&apos;re ready, give the driver the signal.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_12_01">Keep looking for the control room. Must be here somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_12_03">Control room has to be here somewhere!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_15_01">They interrupted the hack! Get it going again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_18_01">Just put the ticket back in the gate and we&apos;re home free!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_18_02">Who had that ticket? Get it to the gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_19_01">Seven bucks!? We were hardly here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_20b_03">Feel the need for speed, gang. Strip the armor off the truck. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_20_03">Any second...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_21_01">Shoot the guards!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_22_02">Get that car out of the way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_23_03">Now let the driver know it&apos;s clear!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_24_03">Guys, the city is locked down! Cops are defending in depth, and you need to drive through. Loud is the only way. Driver&apos;s taking it easy, so stay with the truck!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_25_01">Get Hoxton up to the street. Get him to the safe house!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_brf_01_01">The Dentist got Hoxton a re-trial. Uh, not you, Hox - I mean Old... Look, we&apos;ll sort out names later. The trial will be quick. With his record, he ain&apos;t gonna walk, but that&apos;s not the point. The point is he&apos;s moving, and we can hit him in transit. We&apos;re going to grab him right after the hearing. A nice little &apos;screw you&apos; to the US justice system.$NL;$NL;The plan is as loud as it gets: we blast a wall in the courthouse, grab Hox and get him the hell out.$NL;$NL;Area&apos;s locked down for blocks around. They&apos;ll be expecting trouble. Have your guns ready and pack a lot of ammo.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb1_intro_01c">It&apos;s payday fellas!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_04_01">OK, the server is in one of the offices in the IT Department. Figure out where it is and grab it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_07_01">Get inside the evidence room and find evidence related to Hoxton&apos;s case.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_08_01">You are looking for evidence related to the Hoxton&apos;s case. Take a look around. It will be stored throughout the room. Could be marked out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_08_03">Christ, don&apos;t they organise this stuff. Search through it. Find that evidence. You&apos;re looking for evidence that&apos;s related to Hoxton.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_09_02">Now take the evidence to the lab. If we can find some DNA that belongs to the traitor, we might be able to pinpoint who he is.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_10_01">OK, the traitor&apos;s identity is classified. Not a complete waste though - we got a sample of his DNA! Good work. Now, get back to Hoxton.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_11_02">Damn. No match. Keep looking!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_11_03">Ah crap... Came up blank. Keep searching and keep scanning.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_13_01">This place is locked down tight, but you can use keycards to gain access to different areas. Choose wisely - you probably won&apos;t find a lot of &apos;em.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_15_03">Spend a keycard to access the Infirmary, if you feel like you need a pick-me-up. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_18_02">They&apos;re deploying gas! Get out of the room and wait for it clear.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_19_01">Guys, they&apos;re throwing everything they have at you. Better make it out, fast!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb2_19_03">Cops are getting desperate, they&apos;re launching a final assault! Don&apos;t let them stop you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_02_02">That&apos;s the FBI safe house. Let&apos;s see how safe it really is.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_02_03">The safe house. Let&apos;s put that to the test.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_03_01">First things first; get past the outer fence.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_04_02">Check the fence. Always got to be a way over, through or under.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_05_01">You&apos;re in. Next step is to get inside the mansion. But watch out - all the doors and windows are tied to an alarm.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_06_02">Open a door or window and the alarm timer will kick in. You&apos;ll only have a few seconds to disable it, before it goes to hell.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_07_03">Look inside before going in. Find the alarm box. When you open a door or window, it&apos;ll start, so you need to disable it fast.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_08_02">The countdown started. Disable the alarm before the timer runs out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_11_03">Our target will be in the panic room. Look for it. Once you&apos;ve found it, we can work on winkling that traitor bastard out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_12_02">You&apos;re looking for the panic room. Should be easy to find. Search for a reinforced door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_15_03">The door can only be opened with a code and a retinal scanner.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_16_01">OK. The panic room door is controlled with two keycards and a retinal scanner. No problem.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_17_02">Looks like an entry code and a key are needed for external access. Go look for them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_19_02">My guess is the code is in someone&apos;s email. Find an FBI terminal and gain access.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_20_01">Good, it&apos;s searching the computer now. Make sure no one spots the computer when it&apos;s active.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_20_03">It&apos;s searching now. Christ, wish they spent as much on their servers as they do on their doors. Don&apos;t let anyone see.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_23_01">That&apos;s the pole. Shinny up there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_26_01">Yes, hi, this is Agent Dave from the safe house. I need to talk with the informant urgently, requesting today&apos;s code. Sorry, didn&apos;t get my coffee this morning.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_28_02">Alright, The retinal scanner needs an eye. Unfortunately, one with a pulse. So find the FBI boss there and take him hostage.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_30_03">You need to get that guy to the scanner. Force him to look into it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_31_01">OK, now we need two keycards. Use both of them on the panic room door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_31_02">Now. We need keycards - two of em. Use em on the door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_31_03">Gotta get two keycards working on that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_32_01">OK, you&apos;ll need the FBI boss alive. Keep an eye out and don&apos;t kill him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_36_02">Bile is en-route with the lance. Hold the line!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_37_02">There&apos;s the lance. Grab it, and let&apos;s burn that rat out of his panic room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_39_02">Get the thermal lance onto the panic room door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_40_03">Open the door. Let&apos;s unmask this dirty traitor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_41_03">The rat! Kill him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_42_01">Guys, wait... is that... Hector!? What the... fuck? Why the hell... I don&apos;t get this. Wait... the Watchdogs job, so that&apos;s why the cops were waiting for us. It was an ambush. That son of a bitch.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_42_04">Hector was the one working with the feds!? That son of a bitch thought he could play us for fools. In the end, he&apos;s the one who was crushed, that dirty Colombian rat.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_42_06">Hector&apos;s the rat! That&apos;s why the FBI knew all about Mendoza&apos;s secret bank, because this damn hardliner was feeding them information!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_42_07">Hector was the traitor! He tried to set us up as a part of the Rats job. No wonder the cops found the meth lab so fast. All along, he was the fucking rat.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_44_02">That boss would have been useful alive. Always a back-up though. A *loud* back up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_46_02">Van driver has bailed. Never mind him. OK, I&apos;m getting you a chopper. Stay alive.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_49_01">Shit, there&apos;s FBI Ready Teams in the houses nearby. They are on their way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_50_01">Guys, you better stay inside the house if you can. FBI Snipers are setting up some really nasty sightlines.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_50_03">Damn, snipers are setting up around the perimeter. Watch out and only go outside if you need to!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_52_02">Hmm, must be the FBI boss over by the evidence board. Keep him alive, he might be useful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_53_01">I will personally offer you a reward for all the evidence you bring out. This is about the safety of crime.net.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_54_01">I have an inside man who&apos;s set up surveillance drones and spy cameras. The camera access is on the roof.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_55_03">What?! The timelock has paused. Hmm, could be your ECM jammer that&apos;s messing with it. Better leave those jammers alone for a second.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_57_02">Guys! You didn&apos;t take care of the alarmbox.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_59_02">OK, that&apos;s probably enough stolen evidence to cover our asses but you can always get more!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hb3_59_03">Their case against us probably won&apos;t recover from the amount of evidence we&apos;ve stolen, but you&apos;re free to steal more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_01_02">First job is getting inside. The front door is right there. But there&apos;s maybe other ways in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_02_01">OK. If we&apos;re going to do this quietly, we need to disable some of these alarm systems. Look around. Search the museum. Find the circuit boxes that power security. If we can hack them, we can shut the place down without setting off the alarms.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_04_01">Next step... Two time locks. You need keycards to get past each. Guards won&apos;t have &apos;em - but the civvie researchers probably will. Find and, y&apos;know, persuade them. They&apos;ll give up their keycards soon enough.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_05_02">Ah crap! There&apos;s the time lock. Forget the keycards. Force through those panels.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_07_02">Now, see those lights? That&apos;s your path across. Stay on the path! Step on the wrong tile, and this gets messy fast.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_08_01">You made it! It&apos;s right there! Grab the diamond!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_08_02">You&apos;re through. Look at it. It&apos;s beautiful. Now grab it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_09_03">I can&apos;t believe we actually got the Diamond.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_16_01">OK, the gas is gone. Get back in there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_16_02">Gas is cleared. Get back in there. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_21_02">That&apos;s survellance dealt with. You don&apos;t need to stress over the cameras anymore.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_21_03">Surveillance is blind. Cameras are out of action. Should make things easier.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_23_02">The path will reset after a predefined time window. You can always create a new one. Just make sure you&apos;re not standing there when it resets,</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_24_03">Will you look at that. Hold up! Those floor tiles. They&apos;re pressure sensitive, so stay off &apos;em. Hack the circuit box by the door - that&apos;ll make a safe path across.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_25_01">Will you look at this place. Not your usual vault, huh?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_25_03">Man, I loved coming here as a kid. Made me feel like an adventurer, y&apos;know.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_26_03">Time locks can be taken down with keycards. Civilians have the keycards. You see where this is leading?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_28_03">Always thought being a night-guard at a museum would be a great job. But, you know, the whole stealing thing...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_29_01">We came, we saw... We robbed a whole bunch of old Roman shit.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_29_02">Crazy to think this stuff came from the time of the Caesar&apos;s.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_30_01">Genghis Khan. Carved an Empire from Korea to Bulgaria. Great warrior. Would have loved him on the crew. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_31_02">This place gives me the heebie-jeebies.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_32_01">This place looks like it hasn&apos;t been decorated since the 60&apos;s.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_32_03">Looks like the curator&apos;s basement office.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_35_02">OK, Bile is racing your way now! </string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_36_01">The chopper is fully loaded. Wait for it to come back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_37_01">That was the wrong tile! </string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_38_02">It&apos;s hacked. Good. Find another.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_intro_01_02">Here it is. McKendrick museum. Home of a priceless diamond. Let&apos;s do this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hd1_intro_01_03">There it is. The McKendrick museum. Somewhere in there is a priceless diamond. Let&apos;s get it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_01_03">I... don&apos;t know where we are...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_02_01">Let&apos;s find a way into the prison.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_05_01">Sniper? It... landed on sniper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_07_01">Flames?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_08_03">Flames, that means the flamethrower again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_10_03">Smoke incoming guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_12_01">It stopped on drills. Move away!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_13_02">Question marks? What could that be?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_17_02">Don&apos;t let the cops stop the timer!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_18_01">They interrupted the timer! Restart it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_18_06">Restart the timer! They stopped it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_19_02">When the reboot has ticked down it should restart.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_20_02">Timer has finished. Get the keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_22_01">The keycard you got should get us access to the prison, use it on the card reader by the door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_23_03">Great, let&apos;s keep going.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_26_02">You guys got a keycard, right?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_27_01">Pull the switch and see what happens</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_27_03">What&apos;s taking so long? Just activate that switch</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_27_04">Go by the panel and pull that goddamn switch</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_30_01">I&apos;m sure I don&apos;t have to explain what you need to do.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_30_02">You know your way around this prison, you know what to do.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_31_01">See that timer over there? Hurry up if you wanna secure the loot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_34_01">Get together in a group, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_34_02">You&apos;re done - get together everyone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_34_03">Stick together team.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_36_02">There&apos;s a zipline leading to a train up on the bridge. Zip through the sky!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_36_03">Use the zipline up to the bridge! The train is the only way out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_38_02">What&apos;s that, extra loot? You sure you wanna do that?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hlp_38_03">You sure you wanna be greedy now?</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_01_01">Busting up this motel is our first step to getting Hoxton free. Head in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_04_01">That&apos;s about half of &apos;em.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_09_01">Those motel rooms look like good candidates for a little wrecking. Get in there and get your rockstar on. Smash the TV&apos;s, lamps - anything you can find.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_12_02">A meth factory! Burn that place up. Or, if you can find a formula, get cooking. Can always move a little extra product.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_13_01">Hey, I think that gas station is on our friend&apos;s books. There&apos;s C4 in the DeLorean. Fetch it. Time to go big.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_14_01">Now plant that C4 on the gas pumps. We&apos;ll light a fire they&apos;ll see in Moscow...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_15_01">Yeah! Treat it like it&apos;s Keith Moon&apos;s birthday.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_15_02">Keep breaking things, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_16_01">Some men just want to watch the wheels burn.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_16_03">Commissar&apos;s men don&apos;t look like the kind of guys to have fire insurance.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_16_05">Shame to see such fine wheels go up in smoke. But if it gets the Commissar&apos;s attention...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_17_01">You need to cause damage to get the Commissar to call us. Smash rooms, burn cars, kill his thugs - that should get his attention.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_18_01">You got his attention. But I need longer to establish the trace. Somewhere in DC. Narrowing it down. Keep working.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_20_01">Gotcha! Our guy is somewhere in, hang on...</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_21_01">He&apos;s in West End!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_25_01">Got it. Georgetown! </string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_26_02">Look for something connected to that place.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_29_01">That&apos;s a second hatch, guys. The Commissar must have something sweet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_30_01">You remember that metal hatch you discovered? Secrets worth knowing are often well protected. I&apos;ve been thinking about how we can get through. Bile is en-route. He&apos;ll drop something for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_30_02">I&apos;ve an idea to pop that hatch you saw earlier. Bile&apos;s on his way with a little something for you. Hopefully something down there will lead us to the Commissar.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_33_01">Happy birthday, clowns. Here&apos;s your present.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_35_03">You sure remember how to hotwire an engine. Start it up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_36_01">Is it working? Nice. But damn, that hatch is strong. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_37_01">Three minutes to go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_41_01">Almost open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_42_01">About halfway open now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_44_02">Make sure the cops don&apos;t do that again. Keep it running!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_46_01">Georgetown. Search through the files, the maps on the wall - anything that can pinpoint his exact location. Remember: it&apos;s Georgetown.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_47_01">We know he is in West End somewhere. Look around for anything related to it. Files, maps. Remember: West End.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_48_03">The call came from Foggy Bottom. Find something that will pinpoint the Commissar. Remember - Foggy Bottom.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_49_01">Shaw! That&apos;s where he is. But we need to narrow it down to a precise address. Look for maps or files related to Shaw.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_53_01">I&apos;m sure a lot of nefarious shit goes down at that motel. Take a look around. See what you can find.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_54_02">The Russians stash their loot here? Nice bonus! Toss it in the DeLorean.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_56_01">Drill&apos;s done its work. Get in that basement!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_57_01">Running the barcode now. Shouldn&apos;t take long to get an address.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_57_03">Checking the barcode now. Keep the cops off it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_59_01">SWAT raining down from street level. Watch your heads!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_59_02">Police breaching their way down. Heads up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_61_03">That pilot&apos;s had enough. Yeah, back to base, asshole.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_63_02">Gunship&apos;s firing! Move! Move!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_64_03">Let me remind you - you need to be wiping out the mobsters. Search the motel.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_65_01">More mobsters on the way! Watch out for the vans.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_65_03">The Commissar sent his little chickens. Give &apos;em a warm welcome.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_66_02">Hearing police signals. Someone must&apos;ve called &apos;em. Stay alert.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_66_03">Cop switchboard just lit up. Expect company, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_69_01">There&apos;s a good amount of tasty loot down here. Hustle out as much as you can.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_74_01">Some C4 on that gas station should send a message. Get to it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_74_02">Don&apos;t forget to send that gas station to hell, gang. C4, pumps... You know.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_74_03">The gas station is a nice little earner in this economy. So blast it. C4 on the pumps.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_75_02">Damn! I felt that all the way over here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_77_01">Now just connect it to the hatch.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_77_02">Now head to the hatch and hook up the cable.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm1_78_01">With all of these crates, there has to be a crowbar around here somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_02_04">We need to put the Commissar in a wooden box. Not stay in one ourselves. Move!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_03_01">The Commissar! Get him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_03_03">Thats him! Dont let him escape!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_04_02">He&apos;s taken the elevator! Get up there after him. Do not let him escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_04_03">He&apos;s headed up in the elevator! Chase him! He escapes, the Dentist will be pissed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_07_01">Almost there, guys. Keep going.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_09_01">Where is he?!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_10_01">That crafty bastard! He&apos;s using his vault as a panic room. Let me drop you a thermal drill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_10_03">He&apos;s locked himself in his vault, the crazy Ivan! Break it open. I&apos;m sending you a thermal drill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_11_02">The drill is in the area. Pilot said &quot;through a skylight&quot;. Find it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_14_01">A little hot in there, but you did good.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_14_05">That&apos;s the fires dealt with. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_14_06">Fires&apos; are under control. Now, back to the job.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_15_02">The vault is open. Get in there. Finish him. The Dentist is watching.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_17_03">Caught &apos;em! Now, Commissar is around here somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_18_02">Our inside man provided you a handful explosives. Grab it and knock on that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_19_01">The good news: Commissar has a HUGE stash of coke up in his penthouse. The bad news: he&apos;s flushing it as fast as he can. That&apos;s a lot of money swirling down the crapper - the faster you get there, the bigger the bonus!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_01">Guys, remember! The sooner you get up there, the more cocaine we can grab. </string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_02">They flushed more coke. Guys, you got to hurry if you want to make a big score.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_06">I can&apos;t believe that Russian asshole is destroying that product. Get at it before it&apos;s all gone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_07">Damn, more coke flushed. Thousands of dollars swirling away with the turds. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_10">Powder&apos;s flying like it&apos;s a goddamn bakery in there - if you want in, you&apos;d better book it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_20_18">Keep pushing forward! This is a time limited offer if there ever was one!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_21_01">Aw, this is gonna give me an ulcer, seeing all this coke being flushed and you guys straggling!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_21_05">Do I need to remind you? Cocaine, worth a fortune, is being destroyed as we speak!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_21_06">Get up there and stop them, for crying out loud! This is a tragedy!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_21_07">I don&apos;t know what&apos;s taking you guys so long, but that coke is NOT waiting around for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_21_09">You know that coke is worth a lot, right? Right!? Hurry hurry hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_24_02">OK, whatever... There&apos;s still another way to win: Find and kill the Commissar! I bet you&apos;re motivated now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_25_03">You guys waiting for a pizza? Come on, get a move on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_26_02">Hot damn! Commissar, you dirty old Bertie.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_26_06">Dunno what that guy did to piss off the Commissar, but it must have been bad.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_27_01">Mount a drill on that gate and get it open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_27_02">That should be a quick fix! Get a drill on that gate, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_28_01">This door&apos;s locked with some kinda magnatic mechanism. Find a way to open it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_hm2_31_03">Check out all of Commissar&apos;s blood money. Ah well, someone has to enjoy it. Get it to the chopper, if you can.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_brief_b_03">Alright people, this is a pretty sweet opportunity, All sorts of mid-ranged diamonds and the like in the display cases. Do your worst, make your bones, get on out. A classic knockover.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_end_03">Nice job snatching all those gems guys. I&apos;ll called ahead to my diplomatic contacts - they are hungry for this. Let&apos;s feed &apos;em.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jewelrystore_stage1_intro_04">OK, time for a jewelry hit. We need at least three bags. That should be fairly easy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_01_01">Give &apos;em the authorization, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_01_02">Show &apos;em, gang</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_03_02">Locke wants us to blow that door. Better drop the charges off there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_05_01">There should be a security room close by. Use the arc welder to cut through and green llight the airlock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_06_02">Find the shaft and zipline those bags up to Locke ASAP.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_08_02">Locke wants us to sabotage the radars. Better get to it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr1_09_01">Great job, crew. Locke&apos;s already wired our cut. Still not sure about this guy, but maybe we can trust him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_01_03">You heard Locke, crew - into the cargo hold!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_03_01">Hustle it, guys. You need to get on the ground near the money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_04_02">Gang, don&apos;t forget - you need to light a flare before Locke will come in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_04_03">Crew, remember - Locke needs you to light that flare.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_05_02">Make sure those straps are nicely fastened. Don&apos;t want Locke dropping the loot too early now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_07_01">Get into the boat, gang! We&apos;re almost done here!</string>
	 <string id="pln_jr2_intro_01_02">Hope you&apos;re okay up there, crew. Here&apos;s Locke.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_01_any_01">OK, time for a smash and grab.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_07_any_01">Hit the display cases.</string>
	 <string id="pln_jwl_09_any_01">Get those bags to the car.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_03_any_02">Halfway mark, people. Hurry it up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_06_any_02">There&apos;s ten seconds to get to the van so get to the van now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_06_any_03">Ten seconds.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_07_any_02">Someone got away.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_09_any_03">Wheelman is moving. ETA: One minute.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_12_any_03">Now things get interesting...</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_13_any_01">OK, that&apos;s it. Get it to the escape van... Vlad will be pleased.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_13_any_04">Jackpot! Let&apos;s get it out. But if you wanna be greedy and stick around, I won&apos;t judge you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_14_any_04">We&apos;re on the clock, people!</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_15_any_03">Your escape van just left...</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_15_any_07">We weren&apos;t fast enough here, the getaway just left.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_15_any_09">Sorry fellas, too slow - the getaway just left along with your freedom, look me up when you get out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_knk_jwl_a_16_any_03">Guys find that tiara and find it quick.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_01_01">All right. Safeties off. Get down there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_02_02">Guess the vault is gonna be in a Murky shipping container. Get opening them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_04_01">Vlad wants a word...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_06_03">You need to find crowbars. They are most likely in the warehouse. Jam them into the vault fans. The heat builds inside, and... voila!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_08_01">All right. That&apos;s the first. Heat is building. Disabling more fans will speed this up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_08_02">Okay, great. The temperature is climbing. Wait it out, but jamming more fans will speed it up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_09_01">Nice. It&apos;s getting hotter. What the hell is in there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_10_03">Last fan disabled. Temperature is off the hook. The contents must be scorching!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_12_03">I... uh... okay. So we&apos;re boosting nuclear warheads. Guys, be very, very gentle with those things.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_13_01">Vlad, are you crazy! Nukes!?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_14_02">Those forklifts will be useful for moving the warheads.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_15_01">That train is some distance away. I don&apos;t want you handling those nukes for long. See if you can find a car.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_17_03">We got the armor from here when we did it quiet, you recall?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_18_02">We&apos;re done. Now bail! Leave Vlad with his nukes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1b_intro_01_03">Lot of activity. Stay frosty.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_01_03">That&apos;s the depot. You know what you need to do, but keep it quiet. If the alarm goes, I&apos;ll have to pull you out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_04_03">A nice stash of used dinars. Good find.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_05_01">I hope they weren&apos;t giving this marching powder to our boys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_05_02">This coke won&apos;t be funding any more terrorism. Just good old American crime.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_05_03">Columbian. Bolivian. Mexican. Wherever it&apos;s from, it&apos;s ours now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_07_02">Rifles, pistols and bullets. This will make Gage happy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_13_03">The vault needs two cards, entered almost simultaneously. You can bet there&apos;s something particularly tasty in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_16_01">Those Murkywater containers are brought direct from the world&apos;s hotspots. Crack them open. They&apos;ll be your best bet for loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_17_01">The driver&apos;s gonna bail! Make sure you&apos;re with him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_18_03">Uh, hold on...no flight plans submitted. Who are these guys?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_20_02">A good start.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_21_01">Almost there. One more bag.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_21_02">You&apos;re nearly done. Only one bag to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_22_01">That&apos;s the armor of Oda Nabunaga. Bag the pieces. If that&apos;s genuine...</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_23_01">I can&apos;t believe we scored Oda&apos;s armor. Outstanding work!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_23_03">That&apos;s all four pieces of the Shogun&apos;s armor. This is an outstanding night&apos;s work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_25_03">Gage&apos;s guy is in a nearby parking lot. Throw the loot over the wall to him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_end_01_01">Expertly done, gang. You guys are like shadows.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_end_01_02">That was text-book whisper mode, guys. Great work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_end_02_01">Not pretty. Not a great achievement. But any day you walk away from is a payday. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ko1_end_02_03">You did the job, but with none of the finesse I hoped for. Roll home, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_02_01">As long as those anti-air defenses are functional, Fedor won&apos;t be able to drop the EMP. Find a way to disable them, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_04_02">Set up the laptop to the anti-aircraft gun. Maybe I can work my magic.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_07_01">The AA gun has been disabled! Now, grab the laptop and head over to the next one!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_08_01">Man, these mercenaries have set up for war. There should be some explosives laying around that we could use.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_09_01">You know what to do. Set the C4 up and let it take care of the rest.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_09_03">Place the C4.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_10_01">Stand back, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_10_03">They are about to blow, stand back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_12_01">Damn, the EMP crashed right through the roof of the lumber mill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_12_02">God dammit, Bile... The EMP fell through the roof and is now inside the lumber mill instead of outside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_13_01">Nice drop, Bile! Gang, the EMP is in the yard outside the lumber mill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_16_01">Okay, gang. We need to charge this baby up before it can be used. Gonna take a little while.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_16_03">Okay, we need to charge the EMP before can we use it.Patience is a virtue.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_17_01">The mercenaries are gonna come at you hard! Protect the EMP, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_21_01">Guys, listen! When the EMP goes off I most likely won&apos;t be able to communicate with you for a while. You need to get down to the hidden laboratory via the hatch.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_21_01a">The EMP should have released the magnetic lock. Once you&apos;re down there, find the scanner and the test-subjects.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_21_03">The EMP is almost done, so listen up! This baby is powerful so don&apos;t be surprised if it breaks our communication among other things.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_21_03a">But just stick to the plan and we should be good. Get inside the laboratory through the hatch and find the scanner and the test-subjects.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_22_02">The EMP took care of the magnetic lock, so you have free passage to the laboratory.Let&apos;s go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_22_04">Guys, can you hear me? Hello? Enter the laboratory via the hatch. It should be open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_25_01">You need to find a way to shut off the gas.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_25_02">Guys, look for a way to shut off the gas!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_25_03">There must be some way to shut off the gas!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_28_01">Gang, you need to find the lead scientist.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_31_02">It seems to have worked. You should be able to start the scanning-process now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_32_03">Looks like the power is coming back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_33_01">Alright, gang. You need to look for the test-subjects and get them to the scanner. They are supposed to look pretty much the same.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_34_01">That must be one of the test subjects that Jimmy talked about. Get the body to the scanner so we can get the information we need.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_35_02">Body is in place so start scanning, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_35_03">That&apos;s it. Now we can start the scanning.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_36_02">Don&apos;t let the mercenaries stop the scanning process!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_37_01">They stopped the scan! Start it again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_37_02">Damn, they interrupted the scan! Restart it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_37_03">Guys, the bastards stopped the scan! Get it working again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_41_02">Okay, good. You got the power back. Return to the scanning process.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_42_02">The data from the scanning is being collected on that server in the other room. You can stay and get more data, or you can leave. But I&apos;m sure Jimmy would pay us for the trouble. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_43_03">Excellent decision, guys. If you scan all the bodies Jimmy will pay us good for it. Money doesn&apos;t seem to a an issue for him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_44_01">That&apos;s all of them! No more bodies to scan. Now we need to get the server or we did it all for nothin&apos;.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_44_02">Excellent, gang. That&apos;s all the bodies scanned. Now we need to get our hands on that server storing the data.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_45_03">Excellent, the server is secured. Now, let&apos;s get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_46_02">Damn! I forgot about the briefcase. Gang, listen up. There is a briefcase somewhere in the laboratory.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_46_02a">I need you to find and it and bring it with you. I wouldn&apos;t ask if it wasn&apos;t important.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_47_01">You got it? The briefcase? Good! Now let&apos;s get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_48_03">How did you know I wanted that briefcase? It doesn&apos;t matter, good job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_49_03">We got everything we came for. Now, head for the lake. Fedor is waiting for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_50_03">Great, the server has been secured. Now Jimmy can shut up about it. We did our part. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_51_02">What are you waiting for? Let&apos;s leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_52_01">Alright, that&apos;s the radar controlling the anti-air gun. Blow it to hell. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_52_02">That radar is controlling the anti-air gun. Need to blow it up. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_52_03">Seems that radar is controlling the anti-air gun. You need to blow it up. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_53_03">Guys, search the spot where you landed. Bile has dropped some explosives for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_54_02">Good, you found the explosives. Head over to the radar and blow it up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_55_01">Gang, you still need to blow up that radar.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_56_03">The radar needs to be taken down ASAP. Maybe you could redirect the anti-air gun and blow it up? </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_57_01">Bring those missiles over to the radar!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_57_02">Those missiles will do the work. Get them over to the radar!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_57_03">Hell yeah. Those missiles are perfect. Take them to the radar. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_58_02">Get the missiles close to the radar and activate them. Things are about to go BOOM.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_59_01">Great job, gang. Bile is on his way with the EMP now and will drop it close to the lumber mill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_59_03">Excellent, gang. With the anti-air defenses gone, Bile can now drop the EMP close to the lumber mill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_61_01">The EMP will do two things:  It will get us a way in to the hidden lab. But more importantly: It will knock out whoever they are doing tests on, from what I heard fighting them is not an option.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_62_02">We can not leave without that briefcase! </string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_63_01">What the hell happened to this guy?! Whatever, we need this guys hand.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_brf_01_01">Of all the times to grow a conscience, you decide now is the time? I can&apos;t say I like it, but I can&apos;t say you are making a mistake either. Based on what this Jimmy character is telling us, Akan really needs to be stopped. Your destination is a lumber mill in the middle of nowhere, that is secretly a laboratory run by a strange Russian organization. Jimmy tells me they are conducting some experiments that involve things out of this reality. Break into the lab and get the data Akan is after. Good luck, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_intro_01_01">Damn! They have anti-air defenses set up around the whole factory. Turn the plane around, Bile! Gang, you need to use the parachutes and get out! Right now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mad_intro_01_03">Anti-air defenses?! Are you shitting me?! Turn the plane around, Bile! Do it now! Guys, take the parachutes and jump out! </string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrasch_stage1_end_a_01">That&apos;s it guys. Vlad&apos;s going to get his message through. Let&apos;s cash in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrasch_stage1_end_a_03">OK done. Let&apos;s see what the crazy Russian got in store for us next. </string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrasch_stage1_end_b_01">OK that was severe OVERKILL. Vlad will eat this up. This will really work for him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrasch_stage1_intro_a_03">OK, the mall&apos;s up ahead. Get in, hit it with everything you got, and get out. Try to keep people to a minimum. This is strictly material, not personnel damage. This means you, Wolf.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_03_any_01">Look for storage closets, they might have stuff in them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_06_any_01">10 grand.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_06_any_02">10 grand dollars worth.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_08_any_02">You&apos;re at 20 thousand! Keep on going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_09_any_02">Two-Five-Zero-Zero-Zero, half way! Keep going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_11_any_02">35k guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_14_any_02">That&apos;s it! Now they know not to mess with Vlad.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_15_any_02">You can stay and trash if you want, but the escape&apos;s coming soon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_17_any_01">The van got trashed by the cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_18_any_01">Wait guys, I&apos;ve got a chopper inbound.</string>
	 <string id="pln_mallcrash_stage1_19_any_01">He&apos;ll be there soon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_00a_01">The limo has arrived. Taxman is here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_00b_01">Okay guys, at the right moment, disrupt the deal. Then Alex lifts the limo outta there. Ready now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_01_02">Gang, we need to do this right; both the Taxman and the server is needed, otherwise it all goes to shit. Make sure he has the server on him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_03_02">There he is; the one in the white shirt is the Taxman. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_04_02">Attention gang, the corporation representative is close.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_06_01">The customer is just blocks away now, two minutes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_06_03">Standby gang, the customer should be there in two minutes. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_07_03">Two of them, there&apos;s two guys. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_09_02">I&apos;m eavesdropping now, letting you know what they say. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_10_02">That&apos;s four guys. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_10_03">I see four guys. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_11_02">Okay, keep an eye on what&apos;s happening. We want to actually see the server.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_12_02">He&apos;s approaching the trunk and...</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_12_03">He&apos;s getting something from the trunk. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_13_02">He put something inside his shirt. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_15_01">Alright, he has the server on him. 25 million dollars can be ours. 25 million! And that server he just picked up is the key!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_15_02">Yes, that&apos;s the server! 25 million dollars gang! Now we need to get our hands on that server and get the codes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_16_01">Don&apos;t shoot the Taxman now, shoot close and get him to jump into the limo.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_16_02">Remember! Don&apos;t actually shoot the Taxman, just force him to take cover in the limo. Suppressive fire.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_16_03">Give the Taxman a scare so he jumps into the limo, but don&apos;t actually hit him! </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_17_01">WHAT! Guys get your heads down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_17_02">God dammit! Down, guys! </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_17_03">What the hell! Get down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_19_03">I see nine of them. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_21_01">We are made. Action, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_21_02">We&apos;re compromised! Action guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_21_03">Damn, they have seen us! Action guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_22a_01">Alex, get a grip!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_22a_02">Come on, Alex, get a grip!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_22_02">Alex, ready for the lift.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_22_03">Alright take him out. Alex get the crane in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_24_02">Guys! That&apos;s too early, what if the server isn&apos;t there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_25_01">Alright, get him into the chair.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_27_02">SWAT&apos;s are in the building, coming from the right staircase. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_28_02">SWATS are all over the building - they&apos;re everywhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_28_03">SWATS have stormed the building - watch yourselves.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_29_02">SWATS are incoming from the left staircase, ground floor. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_30_01">They&apos;re climbing up on the balcony straight from the front.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_30_02">Watch the balcony from the front - they&apos;re climbing up. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_30_03">They are are climbing up the balcony from the front.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_31_02">Check the vents!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_31_03">Check the vents, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_32_01">OK, to the roof now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_32_03">Up to the roof now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_33_01">What is taking so long? Move closer guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_33_03">Hurry up gang! Get to the limo!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_35_03">Damn, it&apos;s stuck. Try shooting at the wires. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_36_01">No time to waste, shoot the wires and let it drop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_36_02">I don&apos;t like that sound guys. Work fast!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_37_01">Guys it fell short. It&apos;s on the balcony. Let&apos;s go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_37_02">It landed on the balcony, go, go, go! </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_38_03">I should not have hired you, Alex....</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_40_01">It&apos;s on fire! get him outta there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_40_02">The limo is on fire! Get him out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_41_01">Get Taxman and the server out of the front seat, then get to the transfer room on floor three.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_42_02">Get Taxman and the server out of the front seat, then get to the transfer room on the ground floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_44_02">You could argue we are the good guys in this scenario, right? </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_44_03">Look at us interupting a dirty deal between the IRS and some big corporation: we are like Robin Hood!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_47_01">Great it&apos;s open! Get Taxman outta there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_48_02">We need the server, don&apos;t forget it! </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_49_01">The server&apos;s not on him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_49_03">He doesn&apos;t have the server on him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_50_01">It&apos;s on the roof!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_53_02">OK, hook up the server and let&apos;s go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_53_03">Guys you got a transfer locally, and it needs to happen now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_55_01">We need three administrator passwords.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_57_03">Okay, take it back a little, we don&apos;t want to kill him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_58_01">Watch the neck!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_60_01">Is he dead... guys?</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_61_03">We&apos;re after his codes and the server. Make sure we go gentle on him. We can&apos;t loose him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_62_03">Nope, that&apos;s not enough. Get him talking again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_63b_01">That&apos;s the password, Starbreezer</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_64_03">Good work, i&apos;m right on it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_65_01">The cops cut the power. We need to get it back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_65_03">Damn cops cut the power! Find a way to get it back on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_66_01">Power is out again, get it back up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_66_02">Get the power plugged in. Keep that running.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_67_03">Nice! Now set the computer back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_67_04">Alright, restart the computer and we&apos;ll be back online again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_68_02">Good work. Resuming.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_68_04">We are back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_68_06">God job, I&apos;m back in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_68_07">Great! We got contact again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_69_02">Alright, we&apos;re past the ASIM. They won&apos;t know what hit em.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_70_01">OK guys, the authentication is almost complete. Keep an eye on that timer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_71_02">Guys, I got a callback from the accounting name, When that timer hits zero - we are clear for the transaction.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_72_02">Yes! Money, money, money, money - money! </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_72_03">That&apos;s it! Time to cash in, baby!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_73_01">Fantastic! I confirmed the transaction of 25 million.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_73_02">Excellent! I just got a confirmation on a 25 million dollar transaction. </string>
	 <string id="pln_man_74_01">Here we go. Tax money put to good use.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_75_02">That&apos;s it, time to get the hell outta here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_75_03">We&apos;re done, let&apos;s move and get out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_76_01">Get up on the roof and run over to the connecting rooftop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_76_03">Hit the roof and run over to the connecting rooftop.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_77_01">Keep going guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_77_02">Let&apos;s go, let&apos;s go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_78_01">You gotta make the jump, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_78_03">Yeah, you gotta be a Persian prince to make this jump!</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_brf_01">The Taxman thought he was clever making a deal with a big corporation, but the information leaked, and now bigger sharks want in - all in. We have a complete, run-down building to ourselves, overlooking the deal. We&apos;ve got a set-up installed. Alex will help with the crane. Scare the Taxman into his limo, shake him up, and he&apos;ll be sure to give us the server and the codes. When it&apos;s about $25,000,000, anything goes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_cbf_01">Okay gang, pack your things and head for Washington D.C. We&apos;re going after a gentleman by the name of Sturr. Mr Sturr is a sneaky IRS employee looking to make a lot of money by striking a deal with some dirty big-ass corporation, but I say we could put that money to better use. Let&apos;s do it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_man_cnc_03">We&apos;re gonna break up a dirty deal between a Taxman and some big corporation and make a lot of cash doing it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_misc_sj_dgh_01_02">That&apos;s them! They were here just like Wick said. Tie them up and leave them by the van. Wick will take care of the scum when we get back. </string>
	 <string id="pln_misc_sj_dgh_01_03">That&apos;s them all right. Just seeing them makes my blood boil. Tie them up and leave them by the van. They&apos;re coming with us when we leave. Wick was very specific about this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_misc_sj_dgh_02_01">You killed one of them? Damn, I can&apos;t say the prick didn&apos;t deserve it, but Wick wanted the pleasure himself.</string>
	 <string id="pln_misc_sj_dgh_02_03">You couldn&apos;t stop yourself, could you? Well, the world&apos;s a better place without that bastard, but Wick will be disappointed he wasn&apos;t part of it, so you better leave the other one for him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_misc_sj_dgh_03_02">No! Dammit, gang... Wick wanted to take care of them himself. He really had it in for these bastards. I guess he will have to be content with the idea of them dead.</string>
	 <string id="pln_misc_sj_dgh_03_03">Dammit! Why did you do that? You were supposed to bring them to Wick, not kill them yourselves... I&apos;m not sure how he&apos;ll react to this. This is the only thing he&apos;s been talking about since he saw that disgusting video...</string>
	 <string id="pln_misc_sj_dgh_05_02">They&apos;re getting away from the van. Wick will be pissed if you don&apos;t bring them back to the safe house!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_01_01">You&apos;ve got to free Vlad&apos;s brother-in-law first!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_02_01">You need to wake Santa up. Hit him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_02_04">Whack Santa so he wakes up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_03_02">It&apos;s in the Jewelry store.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_04_01">Ok gang, you need to hack the console.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_04_02">Hack the console to open the display cabinet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_06_01">You need to get to the toy store and find the Tin Boy toy box with the coke.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_07_01">Someone bought the last Tin Boy. Go search all toy store bags you can find in the mall!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_07_02">Go find who bought the Tin Boy! There should be a bag from the toy store.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_07_03">Someone just bought the toy and walked off with Vlad&apos;s stuff. You need to get it back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_08_02">Ok, steal the Tin Boy!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_08_03">You&apos;ve got to steal that toy!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_09_02">Search in the piles and find Tin Boy!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_09_03">Search around for the Tin Boy toy!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_11_01">Check the store inventory and find those shoes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_11_02">Check the computer. Got to find the shoes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_12_01">Drill the door to the storage room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_12_02">Get that storage room door open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_12_03">We need to get into the storage room.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_13_02">Get those shoes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_14_01">You&apos;ve got to open the storage cage!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_14_02">Open the storage cage to get the shoes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_14_03">The shoes should be in the storage cage. Open it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_16_01">Go to the tech store and find the VR headset. There coke should be there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_18_02">Open the safe and check inside!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_19_02">Empty the safe!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_20_03">You have to find that wine in the wine store!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_21_01">Make sure you find the right wine!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_21_02">Find the right wine now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_22_02">Helicopter will be here in one minute.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_24_01">Alright you got it, now put it in the tree.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_24_03">Nice job! Now hide the package in the christmas tree.</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_27_02">Vlad wants the Christmas tree. Bile is on his way now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_29_01">Get away from there! The C4&apos;s gonna blow!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_29_02">Take cover guys! It&apos;s gonna blow!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_30_02">Get that wire attached to the Christmas tree!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_30_03">Attach the wire!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_31_01">Attach the frame to the tree!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_31_02">Get that frame attached to the Christmas tree!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_31_03">Attach the frame!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_32_01">If you got any more loot, secure it in the tree now! Or it&apos;ll be left behind!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_33_02">You&apos;ve got to save Santa by getting him into the tree before it&apos;s flown out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_34_01">Wait for Santa to get into the tree!</string>
	 <string id="pln_moon_34_02">Just hold on until Santa gets into the tree!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_02_01">Uh, okay....</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_02_02">Okay. This is unexpected, but we still have a job to do.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_03_01">We need to add ephedrine tablets to start the cooking process. Find some and add it into the mixer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_04_01">Come on, my little Igors - get the tablets in the mixer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_06_02">Ingredients are almost with you, crew.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_07_01">Okay, there&apos;s the ingredients. Going to need a little extra in there, though. More than one bag.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_07_02">Ingredients have arrived. Going to take more than one load though. Keep throwing them in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_07_03">All right, there&apos;s the ingredients. But this is going to take more than a single load. Keep throwing it in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_08_02">Yes. It&apos;s working. Just need more in there. Keep loading.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_09_02">The meth&apos;s set, but we can&apos;t get it out like that. Break it down. Smash it, shoot it, blast it - just break it down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_10_03">The meth needs breaking up into little pieces. Get angry on it, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_11_01">Add more tablets to continue the cooking. Or signal the helicopter to escape - your call.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_11_02">All right. Now you can keep cooking, or signal the chopper and end this caper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_12_03">That&apos;s it. Now wait for the pilot to signal in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_16_01">Well, in the annals of criminal cock-ups, that ranks high. I can hear the cops laughing from here. Better luck next time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_16_02">Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble. Mostly toil and trouble. Especially trouble.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_17_03">You didn&apos;t get anything out? </string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_21_04">I want to hear a cry of fear from those cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_21_05">One, two, cops are coming for you...</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_22_01">It&apos;s alive! Alive!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_22_03">It&apos;s cooking. What music it makes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_cnc_01_02">Halloween treat, guys. Headed back to the cabin in the woods.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nai_intro_01_01">Here to cook a little meth. Just like we did last summer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_01_any_01">Alright guys, Vlad gave us a tip. We&apos;re gonna rob a nightclub.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_02_any_01">Vlad says the club profits are all in a safe somewhere in the office.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_04_any_01">Enter the club and scout around for the office.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_05_any_01">Alright guys, there&apos;s the office, overlooking the club.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_06_any_01">Try to find a way up there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_07_any_01">Keep them in check. No escapes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_10_any_01">Yes, that&apos;s the stuff! There we go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_11_any_02">The van will be in an alley nearby.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_12_any_01">The man with the van is coming soon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_13_any_02">Escape is here in a minute!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_15_any_02">The van is gonna be here soon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_18_any_01">Go go go! Run!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_bag_01_01">The medic bag is in the bathroom.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_end_a_03">That was a hell of a bar brawl. And now Vlad&apos;s probably on top, cagey old Russian. Let&apos;s go get you that payday.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_end_b_02">Not a cop in the world saw this one coming. Russians will be furious and Vlad will OD on vodka. Let&apos;s get paid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_end_b_04">I&apos;m sure Vlad wanted some more blood but this was clean and mean. The Russians will know they got hit by pros. See you back at the safe house.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_ent_01_01">Cool, now that entrance&apos;s blocked off for a while.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_intro_a_01">OK, it&apos;s an early night. The bouncer looks unusually bright for a bouncer - see if you can get past him or if he needs convincing. </string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_intro_a_02">I don&apos;t want you hanging around that club for too long. I don&apos;t trust this to be as easy as Vlad says. Hit the managers safe and get the hell out. If you get any phone numbers, I don&apos;t want to know.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_key_01_02">Security door. Huh... Someone must have a key.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nightclub_stage1_pkp_03_01">As soon as you get the cash, I&apos;m signalling the pick-up guy to come drive by.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_04_01">Keep a look out for six cameras.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_05_01">You got nine cameras to take care of.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_101_01">You&apos;re falling fast!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_102_01">Guys, they&apos;re still shooting. Be...</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_104_01">Hang in there guys, you&apos;re almost there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_106_01">Use a crowbar on that hatch to get to the roof.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_107_02">Bring the cooler!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_108_02">The elevator is burning. Stay away from the doors!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_110_01">There&apos;s a hatch on the floor.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_111_02">Guys, I can&apos;t read you. If you&apos;re still in there, GET OUT!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_112_01">Great, now down the ramp and get outside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_114_01">Sorry guys, Bile had to leave you for dead...</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_115_01">Whoa. Close one guys. How you feeling?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_115_02">Wow. That was a helluva thing. You all right? No missing limbs?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_11_01">Seven.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_18_01">Ok, that takes care of the cameras.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_18_02">Great, all cameras are dead.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_20_01">Don&apos;t let any of the hostages run off and trigger the alarm, got it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_22_02">Don&apos;t let any hostage run off and trigger the alarm!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_25_01">There goes the alarm. Guess we gotta do this the hard way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_25_02">Crap, someone got to the alarm. Alright, time for plan B.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_26_02">No killing hostages, guys! You&apos;ll attract too much attention.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_28_01">How about next time we do it the quiet way?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_30_02">Pick up the phone and put me through.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_31_01">Guys, answer the phone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_31_03">Pick up the phone, quickly!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_32_03">Uhm, hello?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_32_04">Hello, B-uhm... nurse Bain speaking. What do you need?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_33_04">Really? Ok, we&apos;ll be here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_35_03">They sounded convinced. We&apos;re in the clear for now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_36_02">Gotta speed it up guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_36_03">Don&apos;t know if I can bluff them again, so let&apos;s get this done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_36_05">Close one guys, better not take too long.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_37_01">Guys, you got guards coming. Take them out before they find anything.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_38a_01">There&apos;s someone in the elevator, keep a lookout.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_40_01">There&apos;s a repair man coming to check the cameras.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_43_01">You gotta find the patient file, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_44_02">It&apos;s around there somewhere, check them all if you have to.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_44_04">Hurry up guys! Get this done fast.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_44_05">You&apos;re taking forever guys...</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_44_08">Keep looking, keep looking...</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_45_01">Find the file for a &quot;Mr A. Petersson&quot;.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_46_01">He&apos;s got some serious condition... and we need his blood.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_47_01">I know you don&apos;t like it guys, but it&apos;s a huge payday, and that extra bonus item I need to get my hands on. It&apos;s worth not asking too many questions.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_48_01">Whoa, that didn&apos;t take long!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_49_01">Ah, great. Now let&apos;s have a look.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_50_01">It&apos;s always in the last place you look, right guys?</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_52_02">OK, gotta find a way to make sure none of the hostages does anything stupid. Set up the fake sentry guns.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_54_02">There you go, nice work. Time for a change of threads. You&apos;re gonna need scrubs.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_58_02">Don&apos;t forget- stay in character.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_60_01">Good, that&apos;s a security door stopped. See if our patient is inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_60_02">Door to the ICU is open, get in there and find that patient.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_61_01">If that&apos;s the wrong room, we&apos;ll have to cut the other doors with a saw. We gotta get that blood sample...</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_62_01">Crack them open one at a time, and watch out for cops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_64_01">You&apos;ll know if it&apos;s the right guy, &apos;cause he has a tattoo on his neck.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_65_01">Great, that&apos;s the guy. Start getting blood samples. We gotta validate them before you leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_65_02">Ok, now get a blood sample from the target.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_65_03">There you go, that&apos;s him. Start drawing some blood.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_66_01">Wrong guy, keep looking!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_66_02">That&apos;s not our guy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_71_01">That sample didn&apos;t cut it. You&apos;ll have to get another one, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_71_04">Still not enough, you need to take another sample.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_72_05">Vials break when they hit the floor, you know...</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_73_03">Stay on your feet guys. Getting downed will probably break the vials!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_74_01">You need two samples. Go get &apos;em.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_74_03">You afraid of needles or something? Stick him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_74_04">Get that blood, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_76_01">Call the elevator.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_79_01">Maybe... two minutes. IF I don&apos;t get interrupted.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_80_03">Crap guys, the backwater radio chatter is heating up like a mother. Someone is VERY interested in what we&apos;re doing. Be ready for major trouble.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_81_01">They must have cut the main power, you need to get it back up ASAP!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_81_05">Bastards cut the power. You gotta get it back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_82_01">Elevator aint&apos; going nowhere until you get the power back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_82_03">C&apos;mon guys, get that juice flowing again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_83_01">Great, nicely done. Now keep moving.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_84_01">They cut the power again, get it back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_85_01">There you go. Wait... now I&apos;m getting something about air support? What the hell...</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_88_01">You gotta get more blood into that cooler, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_88_03">We&apos;re contracted for two samples, so get another one in there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_88_04">We can leave one you&apos;ve got two samples in the cooler.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_90_02">This is crazy, the hospital is surrounded. Looks like private military... mercenaries. You gotta go... NOW.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_91_02">Get to the roof and I&apos;ll send the chopper to pick you up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_92_01">You guys forget how an elevator works? Push the button!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_92_02">Activate the elevator!</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_92_03">Come on guys, express elevator... going up as soon as you push the button.</string>
	 <string id="pln_nmh_94_01">That&apos;s strange... merc units are pulling out. </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_01_02">Guys, we&apos;re after the counterfeit money plates. Supposed to be stashed in the basement. Get friendly with Mitchell and get them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_02_04">Get in there. Meet up with Mitchell.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_02_06">Ok, find Mitchell. He&apos;s our guy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_04_03">All right. Try and keep out of sight. It&apos;s all about control.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_05_02">Someone must&apos;ve seen something &apos;cause the police are sending a couple of officers to check out the address.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_05_04">Someone must&apos;ve got suspicious. Cops are on their way to check things out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_06_01">That&apos;s the door, and there&apos;s the code lock. See if you can override the system.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_06_05">Hook the code breakers up, gang. Two locks - get &apos;em both.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_07_02">OK, no time to lose. Start the codebreaker! </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_08a_02">Now do the same to the second code lock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_08_01">Good work, but these guys are clever. The doors are linked so no one can enter the shelter unless the other one is in on it. You need to override Wilson&apos;s system too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_08_02">All right. Good. But the door&apos;s got two locks - one for Mitchell, one for Wilson. You&apos;ll need a codebreaker on the second lock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_10_01">Ok, make sure the codebreaker doesn&apos;t stall, they got a pretty secure system here. Guess you just can&apos;t be too careful these days</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_10_03">The code breakers are pretty old. Prone to crashing. Don&apos;t go too far from them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_11_01">Ok, the cops are here to investigate. If you let them inside the house and take &apos;em out quietly, we&apos;ll remain under the radar.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_11_02">Okay, here comes the cops to investigate. They&apos;re just checking things out, so if you can deal with &apos;em quietly... </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_12_01">Keep going guys - no one&apos;s seen you yet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_12_02">The cops seem to think you&apos;re still in the house, we got a small time window now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_12_03">Well done, still calm and no alarms.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_13_03">That&apos;s gotta be the cops calling, checking things out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_14_02">All right. Damn. Look, just pick up the phone. Let&apos;s wing this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_15_03">They have called in another car. Take care of it. </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_16_01">They&apos;re inside, take them out quietly</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_17_01">Who fired? You guys are made now. Go to plan B!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_17_02">Their neighborhood surely heard that gunshot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_18_02">The neighbourhood watch surely heard that!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_19_04">Stay on the lot, guys. We want to keep this quiet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_20_03">Don&apos;t let them run off!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_20_05">One of the civilians is making a run for it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_21_01">I&apos;ve got a few 911&apos;s here. People&apos;ve seen you, prepare for action!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_21_03">Okay, cop switchboard lit up. Think someone must&apos;ve caught sight of you. Get ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_22_01">Alright, you got far without getting detected, but it&apos;s over now. The cops are reported missing and they&apos;re sending in a SWAT team. The party just got started.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_23_01">You guys are made now, go to plan B!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_23_03">Damn! That&apos;s it for stealth - time for action. Get ready for company!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_24_01">Wow, the police are calling for heavy reinforcement. They&apos;ll be here any moment!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_25_03">Gang, get to the shelter - hustle!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_26_01">Ok guys, get the gates open. Find a crowbar or something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_27_01">Don&apos;t forget the crowbar, team!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_27_02">You need a crowbar for this, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_27_03">Crowbar would be great for this.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_28_03">Ok, behind that door is the loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_28_04">Through this door we should get to the money plates. </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_29_01">Apparently that&apos;s a Franz Jaeger Safe. That lock cannot be drilled, and the entire safe is heavily reinforced. I ran into one of those back in the days. We filled the safe with water and detonated a bit of C4 inside. The water pressure just threw the door open without damaging any of the content inside the safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_31_03">Alright, here&apos;s what you do. Get a drill onto the safe. Make a hole in it. Then, we need to fill it with water. Drag the garden hose down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_32_02">Get drilling the safe, crew.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_32_05">Let me remind you - drill the safe!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_34_01">Almost there guys, just wait for the drill to finish!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_34_03">Drill is almost done. </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_35_01">Great! Start dragging that garden hose!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_35_03">Find the water hose. Bring it to the safe!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_36_01">Go lay down the water hose, move it! </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_36_02">You need to drag the water hose down into the shelter.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_36_04">Get the water hose laid out all the way down to the safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_36_05">Go lay down the water hose, move it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_36_08">Come on, get that hose down to the safe, clowns!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_37_01">Fill her up good, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_37_02">Alright, the hose is laid out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_37_03">The hose is laid out, good job.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_38_01">Get the water hose and connect it to the safe!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_38_03">Now just get that last piece connected to the safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_39_03">Get the water running!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_39_04">Time to put the water hose to use, turn it on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_39_05">Turn the water on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_39_06">Now let the water flow!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_40_01">The cops closed the valve, get it open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_40_03">The cops turned of the water. Get the main valve turned on, it&apos;s in the street!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_41_02">Get that valve open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_41_03">That&apos;s the valve. Open it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_42_08">Turn the water back on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_45_03">SWAT moving in from Keel Street, to the north!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_46_01">SWATS are driving in over the hills, from the south east.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_46_02">SWATS are coming in from the south, by the beach!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_46_03">SWATS riding up by the beach!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_48_02">SWATS are driving in from the west, on Pacific Drive.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_48_03">We got cops moving in from the west. Watch em!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_49_03">They&apos;ve rigged the place with C4!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_50_02">It&apos;s gonna blow! Get out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_50_03">It&apos;s a trap! Out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_51a_03">Jesus...christ.....</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_51b_02">You guys there?!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_51b_03">Are you alive?!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_51_01">Too late!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_51_03">Heads down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_52_02">That was not a bomb shelter either, just concrete and plaster walls, C4 I must say was a bit.. overkill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_54_02">That&apos;s a great bonus you got there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_54_03">Check out those money stacks, must be a good print. Worth a fortune on the streets.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_55_02">At least we got the cash before it blew!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_56_01">Our money&apos;s still burning. That&apos;s sad sad sad...</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_56_03">We blew the money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_56_05">I can see the plume from here, what is that? Is it snow?!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_57_03">Ok, drop the dynamite in the safe and blow it, the water will do the trick!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_58_01">Plant the charge on the safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_59_02">Now that&apos;s hydropool euphoria. Get the loot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_60_02">You got it. Now get it out - safely!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_60_03">That&apos;s it! Now get it out and we can close this caper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_62_01">You see that sweet money printer under the pool? I&apos;m sure we can use it to gain an extra mountain of cash! Get it working. </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_62_02">Hey, you know...there&apos;s a printer there. Why don&apos;t we make a little extra spending cash while we&apos;re here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_62_03">Guys, check out the printing press. Whaddya say we make a little extra cash while we&apos;re here...literally make it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_63_02">Okay, so we need paper and ink. Get them going in the press.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_64_01">Guys, the printer is out of paper! Fill her up! </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_65_01">Dammit, the ink seems to have run out! Replace it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_66_01">Alright, good. That should do it for a while. Try starting her up again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_68_01">The cops shut you down. You gotta find the electricity box.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_68_02">Cops cut the power, you gotta find the electricity box and turn it back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_68_03">Ah, no - the cops cut the power. Find a circuit box inside the buildings and turn it back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_69_02">Turn on the power again!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_70_02">Ok, power&apos;s back - restart the printer!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_70_03">Ok, the powers back on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_71_01">Awesome, it&apos;s printing away nice and steady again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_72_03">That&apos;s paper, that&apos;s ink - now just power it up and we&apos;re in the dollars.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_73_03">Now grab that freshly minted cash. And if you feel like printing more, hey, I&apos;m not going to stop you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_74_01">Glad you asked how we get the counterfeit money out of there. I&apos;m dispatching our pilot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_76_02">All right, we&apos;re done here. The manhole leads down to the sewers. It&apos;s your way out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_76_03">Now let&apos;s finish this. Into the manhole, guys! Time for a sewer escape.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_77_03">Just follow it all the way along. The poop pipe deposits into the Gulf.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_78_02">Get to the ocean!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_78_03">Top side is full of cops, make the escape now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_79_02">Just get beyond the gate. Get it open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_80_02">The Church of Scientology, how I can help you? </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_80_03">Steve&apos;s pet shop, how may I be of assistance? </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_80_04">Papa John&apos;s long stocking boutique, how can I help you?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_80_05">Dragon&apos;s buffet, how can I help you?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_80_07">This is the McKendrick Museum, how can I help you? </string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_81_01">In this messed up world, fake money is still worth a lot. Great job!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_81_02">They got cocky and they paid for it. Fake money is still money in the right hands.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pal_cbf_01">Pack your bags, gang. This one is south of the Mason-Dixie. We&apos;re going after Mitchell and Wilson - couple of counterfeiters down in Pensacola. Running a printing operation out of his basement. It&apos;s a discreet operation, and this guy&apos;s work is solid, so he&apos;s making serious bank. Let&apos;s grab a piece!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_01_02">Well, as Vlad said...the coke is in the goats, and the goats are...well, all over downtown. Track &apos;em down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_01_03">Vlad, you crazy...okay, guys. That&apos;s the deal. Sometimes it&apos;s nukes, sometimes it&apos;s goats. Get looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_02_02">What noise does a goat make?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_03_01">That should be all of them! Time to ride out. Get in the wheels and get out of there. </string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_04_01">Gang, it&apos;s time to bug. Get in the car!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_05_02">Haul the goats in the car. Just don&apos;t let &apos;em crap on the upholstery.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_06_01">Gang, don&apos;t forget one of those goats is up in the apartment.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_06_03">There&apos;s still a goat in the apartment building there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_07_01">The apartment has a sprinkler system, so there&apos;s got to be a valve somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_07_03">These places are required to have sprinkler systems. Find the valve!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_09_01">Great, those sprinklers will put out the fire.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_10_01">Outstanding! Fire&apos;s dying down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_10_03">That&apos;s the fire dealt with. You guys are civil heroes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_11_01">How did the goat get up there? Whatever...look for the circuit box to stop the fan.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_11_03">Sure there&apos;s gotta be a good reason that goat is up in the fan. Just find the circuit box. Stop the fan.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_12_01">Hacking the circuit box will stop the fan.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_13_01">That goat is carrying a live charge. Disable the power.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_13_02">Goats are great conductors of electricity. Turn off the power.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_14_01">Beware the goat! Guys, you need to disable the power first!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_14_03">The goat is electrictrified! Turn off the power!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_15_01">Nope, wrong one. Try another.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_15_02">That didn&apos;t do it. Try a different one.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_16_03">All right, nice. Now fetch the goat!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_17_01">How did it even...?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_17_05">I still can&apos;t figure out how.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_18_01">There&apos;s another one! Caught in the scaffolding! Watch out! Looks like it&apos;s electrocuted! Disable the power!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_19_02">There&apos;s still a goat in the scaffold.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_19_03">Remember - there&apos;s a goat stuck in the scaffolds.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_20_01">Looks like the goat managed to nibble through the power. Ladder&apos;s electrocuted. Disable the power!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_20_03">The goat managed to electrify the ladder. Look for the power box to turn it off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_21_01">Don&apos;t touch the ladder! Disable the powerboxes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_21_02">Ladder&apos;s electrified. Disable it at the power box!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_22_01">Check inside that store. Likely one of our goats wandered in. Drill it open!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_22_02">I&apos;m guessing a goat managed to get into the store. Drill the door!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_23_02">Goats love shopping! Drill your way into the store.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_24_01">Open for business! The business of finding goats!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_24_02">Store is open! Find that goat!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_24_03">We&apos;re in. Now get after that goat!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_26_01">Guys, there&apos;s a goat stuck in the streetlight! Saw it down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt1_28_01">The cops are taking our goats! Get them back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_01_03">Take them out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_02_01">That gunfire will bring the cops. We can&apos;t let them get the goats.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_02_03">That&apos;ll surely bring the feds. Gotta think of a way to get the goats out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_03_03">Let&apos;s hope he stays in the air this time. Hold the cops off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_04_02">Here&apos;s the cops. Get ready, crew!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_05_01">There&apos;s gotta be boards around that barn. Use &apos;em to block the windows.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_05_02">I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find something in that barn to close off the windows.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_05_03">That barn must have something lying around you can nail across the windows.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_06_01">You know what to do guys. Go out there, grab the cage parts and assemble it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_07_01">There&apos;s way too much heat here. I&apos;ll have my guys assemble the cage at the silo.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_07_03">Cops have this locked down. We&apos;re going to assemble at the silo.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_08_01">It&apos;s too damned heavy here. The guys will set up at the bridge.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_11_02">When you&apos;re ready, raise the balloon and the pilot will swing by and collect.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_12_03">We&apos;re ready. You seeing the balloon?</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_13_01">You heard him, gang. Just keep the heat off the goats.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_13_02">Crew, you copy that? Pilot is inbound. Protect the goats.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_15_02">Fantastic! Time to leave. Grab the car, crew!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_16_01">Come on, crew. Don&apos;t fuck up now. Get the car, and hit the road!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_18_03">Stay in the car, dammit!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_20_01">The crafty cops have closed off the bridge. Go to the control room to turn it back.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_20_02">Damn, the cops turned the bridge! Get into the control room there, and turn it back. You need to be on the other side!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_21_03">Right. Okay. Bridge is turning back now. But it&apos;ll take a few minutes. Stay alive, gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_22_02">Godammit! Cops halted the bridge. One of you - get in there, restart it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_23_01">Use the button in the control room to reset the bridge.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_23_02">The control room manages the bridge. Use the buttons in there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_23_03">See that control room? That is where you can reset the bridge.</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_24_01">Bridge is back! Finally. Now, everyone - back in the car and bail!</string>
	 <string id="pln_pt2_25_02">You&apos;ll see the truck any second. Just drive up into it, and we&apos;re done!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_01_any_01">Get into the house and see if you can find Hector&apos;s cooks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_04_any_01">What!? The Mendoza cartel is still there! Take care of them!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_10_any_01">Here they come guys. Choppers and SWAT vans all over the place around you. Stay on your toes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_11_any_01">SWATs incoming from the lumber mill. Keep them away!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_11_any_03">They are coming in from the lumber mill, watch out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_12_any_01">They are coming from the railway bridge! Watch out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_13_any_01">SWATs are incoming from the forest next to the road, be careful!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_15_any_01">You kept them away. Good stuff! They aren&apos;t backing though, so get ready for more of them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_17_any_01">You need to add an ingredient, make sure you don&apos;t use the wrong thing. One wrong step and the lab will torch up like a christmas tree.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_18_any_01">Remember to be careful! We can not use the wrong ingredient. You need to be careful!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_19_any_01">You need to add the muriatic acid to keep the process going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_23_any_01">You need to add the hydrogen chloride to keep the process going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_26_any_01">Wow! Guys? Are you OK? I told you to be careful!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_27_any_01">We can&apos;t use the lab anymore, it&apos;s gone. Take what you have and let&apos;s leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_28_any_01">The process is done! Bag it up, and let&apos;s do another round.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_29_any_01">Get the bags to the van to secure them. Don&apos;t let the cops run away with your hard earned meth!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_31_any_01">Awesome! With all those bags, the trade should be smooth.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage1_34_any_01">Good thinking! Use those boards to barricade more windows.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage2_01_any_01">The gangsters should be waiting up ahead. Keep your fingers off the triggers unless you want this to get messy. Keep your eyes open for anything suspicious.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage2_02_any_01">OK, time to give them the meth.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage2_05_any_01">OK, grab the intel and move.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage2_06_any_01">There&apos;s no time to waste. Get to the van!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage2_07_any_01">Looks like we&apos;ll be doing this the hard way. Stay low and search those apartments for the info! Look for safes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage2_08_any_01">We can&apos;t go through with the trade without the meth. You&apos;ll have to scout the nearby apartments and take the information yourselves.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage2_08_any_01b">Watch out though. If you get caught, they&apos;ll likely try to destroy the intel.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage2_10_any_01">Hurry, they might destroy the intelligence before you have time to reach it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage2_13_any_01">Feds or no feds, we need that intel! You&apos;ll have to search the apartments! Look for safes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage3_01_any_01">The convoy&apos;s stopped, move toward the bus.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage3_02_any_01">Remember, we are after the rat, Head for the bus, keep your heads low and move from cover to cover.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage3_04_any_01">That&apos;s the bus, take them all out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rats_stage3_10_any_01">Good job, the rat is dead, escape helicopter is waiting, unless you want to try to go for the money in that bus, get to the chopper and we&apos;ll get you the hell out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_03_any_01">Remember we will need at least four bags of meth.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_06_any_01">Looks like Hector&apos;s cooks are dead. We have to make the meth ourselves!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_07_any_01">We have to hurry! The cop&apos;s radio is buzzing like crazy. They&apos;re already on their way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_10_any_01">Here they come guys. Choppers and SWAT vans all over the place around you. Stay on your toes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_11_any_01">SWAT incoming from the lumber mill. Keep them away!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_11_any_02">Incoming! From the lumber mill! Stay on your toes!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_11_any_03">They are coming in from the lumber mill, watch out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_13_any_01">SWATs are incoming from the forest next to the road, be careful!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_13_any_02">They are coming in from the forest next to the road! Keep them away!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_15_any_01">You kept them away. Good stuff! They aren&apos;t backing though, so get ready for more of them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_17_any_01">You need to add an ingredient, make sure you don&apos;t use the wrong thing. One wrong step and the lab will torch up like a christmas tree.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_18_any_01">Remember to be careful! We can not use the wrong ingredient. You need to be careful!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_19_any_01">You need to add the muriatic acid to keep the process going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_21_any_01">You need to add the caustic soda to keep the process going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_22_any_01">Add caustic soda, to continue the process!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_26_any_02">Ah, what!? Guys, you have to be careful with that stuff, I told you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_27_any_01">We can&apos;t use the lab any more, it&apos;s gone, take what you have and lets leave.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_30_any_01">Good job. Four bags is good enough to go and do the trade.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_33_any_01">No bags!? The trade will not be good to us. Hope you guys has some tricks up your sleeve for the trade.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_34_any_01">Good thinking! Use those boards to barricade more windows.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_end_a_02">That house is going up in flames. Let&apos;s get the product to Hector and get paid. I wonder how much he pays for the blue. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_end_c_03">We came up a little short. Let&apos;s just play along and try to solve the Rat problem for Hector another way. We&apos;re inventive...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_intro_a_01">Straight ahead and to the right, you&apos;ll see an old two story house. Surprise, surprise, this is cook central. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_intro_a_02">The lab, if you can call an rundown dump like this a lab, is straight ahead. Get in and watch for Mendoza&apos;s soldiers. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_intro_a_02b">Oh yeah, get the meth out before the FBI arrives - they&apos;ve been tipped off, as if you weren&apos;t feeling lucky already.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage1_intro_a_03">Mendoza&apos;s people are on the scene doing the cook - get them clear and reclaim Hector&apos;s meth. You can leave right here when you have the stuff. Go for it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_end_a_02b">Yeah. So we have our work cut out for us...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_end_b_01b">Now you need to go in blind and just take out the Mendozas on the way to the airport, OK? I&apos;d say please but I don&apos;t say please.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_intro_a_02">The Mendozas are about to leave on a jet plane. We need to trade this product for info on them. These guys are scum, but you don&apos;t wanna mess with them. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_intro_a_02b">Just try to keep it in your pants this once and do the trade quiet. OK? OK.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage2_intro_a_03b">Let&apos;s just get it over with and hopefully without bloodshed. We have enough of that ahead of us.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_02_any_01">Remember, we are after the rat, Head for the bus, keep your heads low and move from cover to cover.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_03_any_01">There are Heavy FBI units all over the place, be careful.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_05_any_01">The money is yours to take. If you have the codes you will be able to defuse the planted C4s.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_06_any_01">I&apos;m sending a chopper in for you guys to unload the loot. It&apos;s close by, shouldn&apos;t take too long. Stay tight.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_08_any_02">Oh no! It exploded, watch out! Stay out of that fire!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_12_any_01">Cops and SWATs have arrived, be careful!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_end_a_03">Money and Mendozas up in flames. You made a statement and Hector&apos;s going to like it. Payday coming up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_end_b_02">The Mendoza BBQ was a roaring success. Time to see Hector.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_end_c_02">That&apos;s a relief, you aced this one. Whatever bad rep we had with Hector is all good now. I feel relaxed enough to smoke a victory cigar, in fact.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_end_c_03">Great score, folks. Let&apos;s see if Hector&apos;s going to throw us a party, shall we?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rat_stage3_intro_a_01">Crew, this is us ending Mendoza ops in DC right here and right now. Hit that bus hard and take their money. Hector just wants these clowns ended so the money is ours. Set down in 3, 2, 1, go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_02_02">There are only a few ingredients left. You want more, just use a flare to signal the helicopter. He&apos;s got what you need for cooking more. Or you can bug out now. Up to you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_03_02">OK, now wait for the pilot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_04_02">There&apos;re the ingredients. Grab &apos;em! Secure them in the house.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_05_02">Alright. Don&apos;t burn the place down, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_05_03">Great. Let&apos;s cook a little more product. Just don&apos;t set anything on fire.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_06_01">You know the deal: signal the helicopter to catch more ingredients. Or leave the place, up to you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_06_03">Out of ingredients again? No problem, signal the chopper for more. Or get out of there. Your call.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_07_03">There&apos;s supplies waiting for you, gentlemen. Secure &apos;em by the lab.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_08_01">We can&apos;t use the lab anymore, it&apos;s gone</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_brf_01_01">This is a simple job, but that doesn&apos;t mean it will be easy. We&apos;re going to head out to the forest. You remember the place. We did some work for Hector out there. Anyway, I scoped the place out and it is still intact. So, we&apos;re headed there to cook up as much meth as we can. You can stay as long as you want. If you run out of supplies, I&apos;ll get more flown in. Should be easy money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_cbf_01_01">You guys remember that sketchy old house out in the forest? Where Hector&apos;s guys were cooking up meth? Well, we&apos;re headed back there. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_end_04_01">Hot damn! You guys did great! Enjoy your payday - you deserve it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1b_intro_01_02">This is the place. It&apos;s hardly changed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_01_any_01">They turned the power off! The lights are down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_01_any_02">They cut the power to the house! Lights are down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_01_any_03">Cops killed the lights - get it back on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_02_any_01">Get that power back or this turns ugly in a flash.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_02_any_02">We gotta turn those lights back. Get on it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_06_any_01">Get into the house.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_07_any_01">Remember we will need at least 3 bags of meth.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_08_any_01">Goddammit! Someone got here first... Careful...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_08_any_02">Watch out! Their guys haven&apos;t left yet, waste &apos;em!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_09_any_01">Make sure noone else is there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_09_any_02">Check that place for the competition.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_10_any_01">So... If the cooks are dead... Then we... Need to do the cooking ourselves.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_10_any_02">Hectors cooks are dead. We need to do the cooking ourselves... OK...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_12_any_01">Good,OK, the reaction seems fine, keep going. </string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_12_any_04">OK, OK good.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_12_any_05">Alright on this webpage. What did you just add? Alright. OK, OK.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_12_any_07">OK, let&apos;s try that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_12_any_08">OK, solid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_12_any_10">Legit... I&apos;m sure. Cooking fine.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_13_any_03">They&apos;re breaching the house!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_14_any_02">Cops climbing the outside. Get to the windows!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_14_any_03">Shit, you got crawlers outside. Watch those windows!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_20_any_02">Ah, OK... Muria, muriatic acid. Add more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_20_any_04">Mu... Muriatic acid - we need some more in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_22_any_02">Says we need club soda to get this temperature up... Sounds odd. What can you get?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_22_any_03">Caustic basic reaction is now added. OK you got any soda around? Add it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_24_any_03">Hydrogen... Is that a gas... Can&apos;t be a solid... Says add it. You guys got a gas tank?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_24_any_04">This site says something else... Chloride soda hydrogen mix. I don&apos;t know, go for it - something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_24_any_06">It needs hydrogen chloride, for sure... No, no wait... Yeah, OK.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_24_any_07">Fuck me, we needed those cooks. I&apos;m going with hydrogen.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_08">Woah. What are the odds? Yeah maybe they weren&apos;t that good...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_12">Woah, that&apos;s a whammy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_13">Did you hear that loud bang? Guys?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_20">Turns out, we&apos;re really good at making bombs...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_25_21">Wait guys, I think I&apos;m confusing these CAS registry numbers. ...guys?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_a_01">Alright, let&apos;s see...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_a_02">Hold on...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_a_04">So, next step iiis...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_a_05">Now we need...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_a_06">Alright, next ingredient...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_a_09">Uh, if I read this correctly... uh...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_b1_01">Muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_b1_03">Acid. Muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_b2_02">Oh I&apos;m going with muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_b2_03">We&apos;ll go with muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_c2_03">We&apos;ll go with caustic soda.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_c2_06">Oh I&apos;m going with caustic soda.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_d1_01">Hydrogen chloride.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_d2_01">...hydrogen chloride?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_d2_02">I&apos;m going with hydrogen chloride.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_d2_03">We&apos;ll go with hydrogen chloride.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_e_03">You got some of that somewhere?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_e_04">That should get things cooking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_e_08">Add it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_e_09">Add some.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_e_10">Pour it in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_f_02">Hold up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_f_03">No, wait!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_f_06">Wait a minute!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_f_08">Wait!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_f_09">Hold it! You didn&apos;t put it in yet, right?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_g_04">We need muriatic acid!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_g_05">Yeah it&apos;s acid, muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_g_07">I messed up. It should&apos;a been acid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_g_08">By method of elimination it has to be muriatic acid.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_h_02">It should be caustic soda!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_h_03">That should&apos;a been caustic soda!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_h_08">By method of elimination it has to be caustic soda.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_i_01">It&apos;s supposed to be hydrogen chloride!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_i_02">It should be hydrogen chloride!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_i_03">That should&apos;a been hydrogen chloride!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_i_06">My bad. It&apos;s hydrogen chloride.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_i_07">I messed up. It should&apos;a been hydrogen chloride.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_i_08">By method of elimination it has to be hydrogen chloride.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_07">...for sure. Or, most likely.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_08">...that&apos;s my best guess.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_10">...it has to be.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_13">...this website better be accurate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_16">...yeah... yeah.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_18">...and kiss your lucky charms.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_19">...it&apos;s a toss-up, really.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_22">...I&apos;m 86% sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_23">...I&apos;m 84% sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_26">...I&apos;m 68% sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_27">...I&apos;m 65.5% sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt1_j_28">...I&apos;m 57% sure.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_07_any_02">Watch that C4 - they rigged the whole bus.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_13_any_02">Get to that chopper people. We want to get off this bridge too.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_14_any_04">Code will defuse that C4! </string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_14_any_05">Another C4 - defuse it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_16_any_01">Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_17_any_02">It&apos;s going to blow! Run!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_17_any_03">Get the fuck out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_18_any_01">Kill all the rats on that bus. Hector wants no one to step off at the next station.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_18_any_02">That bus. Get up there and hose it with bullets. The Mendozas are all there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rt3_19_any_01">That&apos;s a clean sweep. All the Mendozas are history. Get to the chopper or go for the money they got on that bus.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_01_02">Go get him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_01_03">Don&apos;t let him get away!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_02_02">Shoot him! He&apos;s getting away!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_02_03">Shoot him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_03_02">I hear cops&apos; sirens everywhere. You&apos;re gonna get a lot of heat, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_05_01">You gotta get moving!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_05_02">Come on, get Matt!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_06_03">Go! Go! You gotta meet up with the driver!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_07_03">Chasing Matt like this again, what are the odds?</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_08_01">You can&apos;t let that bastard get away!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_09_01">Keep moving, they&apos;re locking you down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_09_02">Come on, move, they&apos;re locking you down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_10_01">Matt seems to have crashed his car! Go on forward!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_11_03">There it is! Right after the underpass!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_12_03">Ow, that must have hurt! Is he even alive?</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_13_01">You gotta get Matt out of the van.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_13_02">See if you can get him out of the van.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_13_03">Try to get him out of the van.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_14_01">Look around, see if you can find some gasoline.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_14_02">We&apos;ll try to smoke him out - find some gasoline.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_14_03">Find some gasoline so you can set the vehicle on fire.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_15_01">Look for some fuel!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_15_02">Bring some gas cans!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_16_01">Alright, fry that bastard, see how long he lasts.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_16_02">Let&apos;s barbecue him. Make sure he&apos;s well done!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_17_01">He&apos;s sweating bullets by now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_17_03">It&apos;s starting to smell like fried pig now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_19_01">The fire is dying. You need more gas!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_19_03">More fuel to the fire, guys. Find it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_20_01">Hmm, Bile is right. You should get to the top of the overpass so he can pick you up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_21_02">Keep going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_23_01">You heard him guys. Clear the pickup zone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_23_02">Ok, clear the pickup zone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_24_02">You gotta clear the area of cops or Bile won&apos;t be able to get close!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_25_02">Clear the pick up zone!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_25_03">Clear the area of cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_26_01">You need to shoot the gas can to set it on fire!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_intro_03">What... it&apos;s Matt Roscoe! Of course that weasel had to be involved! Maybe you should just kill him here and now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_intro_04">It&apos;s Matt Roscoe! Don&apos;t let him get away! Maybe you should just kill him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_intro_05">What... it&apos;s Matt Roscoe! Of course that weasel had to be involved! Maybe you should just kill him here and now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_run_intro_06">It&apos;s Matt Roscoe! Don&apos;t let him get away! Maybe you should just kill him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_01_01">Huh... everyone must be at the beach.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_02_01">Get in character gang, time to meet Cabot&apos;s boys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_03_01">No time to take in the sights.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_03_02">C&apos;mon guys, let&apos;s be professional, not late.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_03_03">We only have a short window of opportunity guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_03_04">Let&apos;s get this thing going, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_03_06">Guys, you need to get moving.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_03_07">No time to stop for coffee.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_04_02">I guess I should be surprised to see Gensec out there, but those guys seem to be spreading.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_04_03">Why would Gensec have a truck out there?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_05_01">Easy gang, let&apos;s not start the party early.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_05_02">Whoa guys, don&apos;t blow it open too soon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_06_01">Cop chatter on the radio just went off the charts gang!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_06_02">Radio&apos;s going crazy. Cops all around!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_06_03">Comm systems just went haywire. Cops incoming.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_08_03">Mr Blonde, did you bring a few cans of the cold stuff like I asked?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_09_01">Great. OK guys, first you need to access the vault. Blueprint says it&apos;s in the back office.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_10_03">You&apos;ve got a security door blocking you though.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_12_01">Hack me into the lobby computer and I&apos;ll unlock the door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_12_03">Get me into the network via the lobby computer and I&apos;ll take care of the lock.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_13_04">How&apos;s that network connection coming?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_13_05">Hook me up guys, c&apos;mon.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_14_02">Connection lost. What&apos;s going on?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_15_03">Strange blockers on the network. Almost done though.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_16_03">Door is unlocked.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_17_01">Now get to that vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_17_02">Get some eyes on that vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_18_01">Hurry up guys, check that vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_18_02">No time here gang, get to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_18_03">We need to take a look at that vault guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_18_05">You really need to take a look at that vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_18_06">Stop screwing around and get to the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_19_01">That&apos;s what I was afraid of. No way our usual stuff will take this out. You&apos;ll have to get medieval on it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_19_03">Damn, that&apos;s what I suspected. Explosives alone are not gonna get you inside that, but I&apos;ve got a plan.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_20_01">First thing to do is mount a couple drills on that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_20_03">First, we need holes. Get two drills on that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_21_03">Guys, we&apos;re running out of time. Get to the drills.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_21_05">Got those holes drilled yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_23_01">Cops don&apos;t do this kind of crap. Something new is brewing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_23_02">This isn&apos;t right. Not even the Feds do this kind of crap.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_24_01">Building schematics show a high-voltage box on the upper floor. If you can shut it down, the vault will be safe.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_25_01">Good, now go ahead with the drills.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_25_03">That did it. Get to drilling that door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_26_01">Look out guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_27_03">Prolonged exposure can kill, so you gotta decide if you want to risk going in now or wait it out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_28_01">Looks safe now, go ahead.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_28_03">Should be OK to enter the vault now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_29_01">How long were those guys in there?!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_29_02">WHAT!? How long must they have been waiting?!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_30_02">Some loose stones over there if you wanna grab them on the way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_30_03">Someone isn&apos;t too worried about thieves...</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_31_02">I guess I should be surprised to see a GenSec truck out there... But those guys seem to be spreading.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_32_01">First drill done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_32_03">Okay, first drill is through.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_33_02">Great, the drills are through.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_34_03">OK, the special ingredient for the vault we&apos;re going to use is liquid nitrogen, courtesy of Mr Blonde.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_36_01">Then I guess my guys will have to do the real work. Get the tanks from the car, guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_36_02">And you couldn&apos;t be bothered to bring them in while my guys were protecting your neck? Alright gang, go get those nitro tanks from Mr Blonde.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_37_02">You still need to get the nitrogen tanks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_38_01">Ok, now mount the tanks onto the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_38_02">Great, you now need to empty the nitro into the vault door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_39_01">Trust me guys, this science stuff is gonna work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_39_02">I did the research, this is gonna work great.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_40_01">Both tanks need to go on the door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_40_02">You need to mount both tanks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_40_04">Hurry up guys, mount those tanks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_41_01">Great, now just let it pour in there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_42_01">Tanks should almost be done. I&apos;ve got Bile coming with a package for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_43_01">Nitro tanks are empty by now. Doors should be supercooled.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_43_02">OK, don&apos;t think the doors can get much colder.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_44_02">Bile&apos;s package of C4 just came through the roof. Go up and get it, then stick it on the vault.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_44_03">That crash in the roof you just heard was your C4. Get it and blow that vault!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_45_02">Explosives on the door, ASAP!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_45_03">Get that C4 on the door.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_45_04">Let&apos;s crack that frozen vault!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_45_05">Vault should crack like and egg!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_46_01">Told you it would work, didn&apos;t I?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_46_02">I knew that would work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_48a_02">Right guys, if you make your way out by the Big John&apos;s Burger Joint, the cops will hopefully follow you so that Blonde can get the car out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_48b_01">Ok gang, let&apos;s give Mr Blonde some help with a distraction. Lure away the cops by getting out through the shopping street.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_48b_02">Ok gang, let&apos;s give Mr Blonde some help with a distraction. Lure away the cops by getting out through the shopping bazaar.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_48_03">Let&apos;s give Mr Blonde a diversion. Make a break for it over by the Jack Rabbit Slim&apos;s so the cops will follow you and not Mr. Blonde and the loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_50_01">Guys, shoot up that burger joint and get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_50_04">Mr Blonde is waiting on us to get the cops off him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_51_02">You need to distract the cops. Get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_51_04">Mr Blonde is waiting on us to get the cops off him! Make your way out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_52_01">Eyes on the rooftops! I&apos;ve got a feeling this is going to get worse.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_52_03">Watch the rooftops guys! Something&apos;s coming, I can smell it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_53_03">Get through that door! Twitch is standing by with the van!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_54_01">Get out of there guys.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_54_02">Twitch is waiting and getting antsy!</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_54_03">Hurry up guys, my grid is lighting up like crazy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_55_02">Ok gang, no time for backslapping. Get out of there AS --- something ---.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_cbf_01">Guys, we need to talk about what happened up in Alaska, but I&apos;ve got another job first, while you&apos;re still out west. So, the son of an old friend of mine in L.A., member of the Cabot crime family needs help hitting a jewelry store for a haul of diamonds. I owe him big from years ago, when his dad got me out of a jam, so I promised him a little extra muscle as payback. These guys are pro&apos;s, real characters. They even use code names! You guys up for it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_intro_02">Time for some leisurely shopping in Angel City.</string>
	 <string id="pln_rvd_intro_03">A nice quiet day in the sun. Bring back some autographs.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_01w_01">Ok, here comes the first wave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_01_01">Defend against the cops! Don&apos;t let them grab any money bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_02w_02">Get ready for the second wave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_03d_01">You&apos;ve defeated the third wave of cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_03w_01">Ok, here comes the third wave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_04w_01">Ok, here comes the fourth wave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_05d_01">You&apos;ve defeated the fifth wave of cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_05w_01">Ok, here comes the fifth wave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_05w_02">Get ready for the fifth wave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_06d_01">You&apos;ve defeated the sixth wave of cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_06w_01">Ok, here comes the sixth wave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_06w_02">Get ready for the sixth wave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_07d_01">You&apos;ve defeated the seventh wave of cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_07w_02">Get ready for the seventh wave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_08d_02">Nice work! The eighth wave was beaten back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_09d_02">Nice work! The ninth wave was beaten back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_09w_02">Get ready for the ninth wave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_10w_02">Get ready for the tenth wave!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_brf_01">I don&apos;t know who tipped the cops off, but I have good information confirming that they don&apos;t know who&apos;s on the premises. They&apos;ll be expecting a routine raid on a possible drugs operation. Give them a warm welcome, teach them to get their intel right.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_cbf_01">Listen up! Someone has tipped off the cops about suspicious activity at the Safe House. Units are on their way as we speak to do a search and seizure. They don&apos;t know it&apos;s you, though - boy are they in for a surprise.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_ctb_03">Hey! They took one!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_ctb_04">Cops are taking your money, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_dfb_03">Don&apos;t let them take the bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_end_01">Ok gang. My mole in the police will take care of this. He&apos;ll send his guys to clean up and then report that the area was searched and they found nothing. No one will know you&apos;re here, you can relax.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_gwa_02">Here comes another wave of cops!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_gwa_03">Another wave of attack incoming!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_gwa_04">Here they come! A wave of cops incoming!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_gwa_05">Police attack wave incoming - they&apos;re swarming in guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_gwd_02">Great defense, gang! None shall pass!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_gwd_03">Looks like you beat that wave! Keep it up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_gwd_05">You took that wave out! Great work!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_intro_01">This is your home, guys. Don&apos;t let the cops invade it. You&apos;ve got to fight them off and stop them from taking your hard-earned money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_kb10_01">You&apos;ve got to keep at least 10 bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_kb3_01">You&apos;ve got to keep at least 3 bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sfr_kb5_01">You&apos;ve got to keep at least 5 bags!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_01_03">That fence over there is your way in. Cut it open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_02_03">Keep moving and get inside.This might be a game to you, but there are guards all around.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_03_02">Nice to see you still have a keen observation. Take him out and do it quick.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_03_03">Yeah, I agree. You&apos;ll have to take him out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_04_02">Hurry! Answer his pager before they raise the alarm. Try and improvise or something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_04_03">You need to answer that pager fast, otherwise they&apos;ll sound the alarm. Just say something reassuring.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_05_01">Okay, good. Now, bag that body and get it out of sight before someone comes looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_05_03">Next step is to bag that body before some idiot finds it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_06_02">How about that dumpster?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_06_03">That dumpster should do the trick.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_07_02">Okay, good. Now, keep going.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_09_01">Eh, screw it. It doesn&apos;t look like you&apos;ll be able to pass him undetected. Take him out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_09_02">Damn, it looks like you won&apos;t be able to get him that easily. Take him out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_09_03">Yeah, you&apos;re not getting past that guy without too much risk. Take him out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_10_01">Don&apos;t forget to hide the body.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_10_03">Remember to hide that body.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_12_03">I got your back this time, but in the future you&apos;ll have to pay for these kinds of &quot;special&quot; favors. My contacts are good people and they expect good money in return.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_14_03">One of the guards must have discovered the body! Hurry and take him out before he ruins everything!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_16_01">Behind those crates should do. Now, get the other guy. Remember to grab another body bag.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_16_02">Hiding them behind those crates should be good enough. Don&apos;t forget a body bag for the other guy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_16_03">Those crates should work as a hiding place. Drop both bodies there. Get a body bag for the other guy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_18_02">Damn, another guard... and he&apos;s watching the server room. We don&apos;t have time for this. Just take him out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_18_03">It&apos;s not our lucky day it seems... that guard is watching the server room. Get rid of him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_19_01">The Control-Guy seems to be a real dumbwit but we can&apos;t fool him forever. I&apos;m betting he&apos;s sounding the alarm next time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_19_02">That Control-Guy doesn&apos;t seem to be the brightest tool in the shed, but next time even he will understand something&apos;s wrong.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_19_03">We&apos;re lucky that Control-Guy is stupid as hell, but he&apos;s getting suspicious. Next time he&apos;ll most likely sound the alarm.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_20_01">Throw him down there. It should be safe enough.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_20_03">Throw him down there where no one should find him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_21_01">Do you see the flash drive? It should be in a laptop or something.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_22_01">Excellent. Now, remember to steal something. We need to make it look like a clean-cut robbery and nothing else.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_26_02">Remember. Don&apos;t kill this guy. If you answer the pager the Control-Guy won&apos;t fall for it again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_28_02">Easy now, Speedy Gonzales. Hang back and let him pass first.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_29_01">Dallas, my man. You still got it. Now, throw the loot in the back of the van and let&apos;s get the hell out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_29_02">Dallas still got what it takes. Impressive. Now, get the gold to the van and let&apos;s get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_30_02">Not our smoothest ride together, but we got what we came for. And with the gold you took, it should fetch us a good payout. More than enough to get back on your feet.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_intro_01_01">All right, this is the place. Remember, we&apos;re here for the access codes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh11_intro_01_03">Here we are. Time to get back in business. Feels good, doesn&apos;t it?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_01_03">The database should be on the second floor of the building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_02_03">The main entrance would be suicide. We&apos;re sneaking in from the side instead. Put on your mask and cut open that fence.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_05_02">Deploy ECM Jammer and then lockpick the door. </string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_05_03">Use the ECM Jammer to disable the camera, that way you can lockpick the door undetected.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_08_01">Damn it, Dallas! I told you to use the ECM Jammer. Destroying it will draw unnecessary attention.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_09_01">This is what happens when you&apos;re away from the life of crime for too long.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_12_01">Now get back inside and look for the computer.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_13_01">Dallas, sneak past it and look for the security room. Life will be easier if we disable all cameras in the building.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_13_03">Sneak by it and look for the security room. If we do that, we can disable all cameras at once.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_15_03">Go and see if you can find one somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_16_01">Stay under the cameras and they wont be able to spot you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_18_01">Answer the pager and we should be fine. The cameras won&apos;t present any more trouble.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_19_02">That console panel should control all the cameras. Give it a go and see if you can find the computer we&apos;re after.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_21_03">You don&apos;t want to get detected when we&apos;ve come this far. Try and sneak past him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_24_01">Grab the USB flash drive and get outta there. And, Dallas, don&apos;t get sloppy here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_24_03">Bring the flash drive with you and get out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_25_03">Job well done, Dallas. The van&apos;s waiting for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_27_02">I stashed some more body bags if you need some. Always plan ahead, Dallas. Always plan ahead.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh12_brf_01_01">All right, Dallas. It&apos;s time to use those access codes we stole last night. Find a way inside the building - access the Police database and delete all the intel they have on Crime.Net. This won&apos;t be a walk in the park, so show me you still got what it takes.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_01_02">Don&apos;t put on your mask and case the area first. </string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_02_01">These civilians don&apos;t give a crap about you as long as you act normal.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_02_02">These civvies have their own lives to think about as long as you don&apos;t scare them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_02_03">These civilians don&apos;t get paid enough to care about your business. Don&apos;t scare them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_03_01">The manager&apos;s office is where the coke is, but watch out for mobsters.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_04_01">Take him out, or try and get by him unnoticed.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_04_02">That&apos;s one of the mobsters. Sneak or kill: Your choice.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_05_01">Okay, yeah. You&apos;re not getting past that guy without taking him down. It&apos;s show time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_05_03">That guy won&apos;t move on his own, so that means it&apos;s time to force him. </string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_06_01">Good shooting! Okay then. The coke should be in that safe so get drillin&apos;.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_06_02">And down they go. Okay, I&apos;m betting the cocaine is in that safe so it&apos;s time to drill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_07_03">Let&apos;s see if there&apos;s anything else of value while waiting for the drill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_08_01">Heads up, Dallas! The cops are here! Take &apos;em out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_08_03">Damn, the cops arrived faster than I expected! Take &apos;em down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_09_01">Holy...! They setup a sniper in the building across the street! Keep your head down and take him out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_09_02">The bastards brought in a sniper! He&apos;s in the building across the street. Find some cover then take him out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_09_03">The cops brought in a Sniper! He&apos;s in the building across the street. Take your aim and take him out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_11_01">Nice job, Dallas. Now, get the cocaine and head back to the van. Our work here is done.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_11_03">Impressive work, Dallas! Okay, take the cocaine and run back to the van.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_intro_01_01">Okay, first things first. We begin by &quot;casing&quot; the surroundings like any professional heister. </string>
	 <string id="pln_sh21_intro_01_03">Ready to party like the old days, Dallas?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_01_01">A helicopter is coming to pick you up, but it&apos;s going to take a while.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_01_02">I&apos;m getting a helicopter to pick you up, but it&apos;s gonna take some time.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_02_01">Holy . . .! SWAT-team incoming! Take &apos;em out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_02_02">Heads up, the SWAT-team is here! </string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_03_01">Don&apos;t just stand around! Help your teammate up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_03_03">Your buddy needs your help! Go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_04_01">Don&apos;t forget the coke in the van, or all of this would be for nothing!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_04_02">Get the cocaine from the van!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_05_03">Head for the store and grab a hostage so we can negotiate our friend back from the cops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_07_01">Just sit back and let me negotiate a deal with the cops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_07_02">You take it easy for now, while I make a deal with the cops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_07_03">I&apos;ll negotiate a deal with the cops, so we can get our friend back. You just sit tight.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_08_01">OK, it&apos;s done. Release the hostage now to trade back our friend.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_08_03">The deal went through. You can make the trade now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_10_01">Good. Now, don&apos;t forget to pick up the coke again.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_10_03">Okay, you should be fit for fight again. Grab the cocaine.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_11_01">Okay, get out of there. You don&apos;t have time to pick the lock, so just shoot the door handle.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_11_03">OK, time to leave. Don&apos;t lock-pick that door, just blow off the door handle.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_12_01">Wait! Don&apos;t shoot that cop, he&apos;s alone! Intimidate him to work for us instead!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_13_02">Get to the roof now, and wait for the helicopter!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_14_02">Watch out! SWATS on the roof!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_14_03">Heads up! SWAT!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_15_03">They brought in a Sniper!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh22_18_01">That&apos;s it! Time to go! You still got it, Dallas!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_03_01">There is a room behind the kitchen, go there, I&apos;ve prepared the starting kit for you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_04_01">I got the pre-order kit in the back for you. Go get it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_05_01">There we go, now put your mask on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_09_01">Look up.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_14_01">Pick it up. It&apos;s your money that I laundered. Some extra in there for your generous contribution to OVERKILL.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_18_01">OK that should be 5k to start with. </string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_19_01">Some cash, look at it as a welcome gift to get you started. I expect you will pull in much more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_28_01">OK, to your left is your Crime.net station. This is where you get your contracts. To your right are your security cameras. Look around and I&apos;ll tell you more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_31_01">Welcome to Crime.net. This is your crime community. I will hook you up with crime contacts all over DC looking for guys like you. This net is built on mutual trust and money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_31_01b">We&apos;ve been growing this for over two years. There should be plenty of new contacts for you to make on your own as well.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_39_01">Let&apos;s see, what else. You can test any of the objects out in here - just pick up the equipment and find something it fits on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_40_01">So the safes can be drilled, even picked - if you have the skill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_44_01">Good luck - those things are tricky.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_45_01">In the field, if you trip an alarm, the cops come buzzing. DC&apos;s got a lot of them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_47_01">Ammo bags, ECM jammers, medic bags, trip mines, sentry guns.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_49_01">Oh yeah. Pagers. </string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_51_01">I set up a little test case for you to see how these work.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_53_01">Generally the rule of thumb is, they&apos;ll only believe you for a little while once the pager goes off.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_59_01">If you get enough... Maybe we can upgrade this place, huh?</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_60_01">For now, just enjoy the view. We&apos;ll put more in here, I promise.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_62_01">Otherwise, any questions? I&apos;m sure you can figure out the rest. Feel free to come here whenever you want.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_63_01">It might be worth coming by consistently. </string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_68_01">Here you can hang all your modified weapons. It will be quite a rack.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_69_01">The laundry is a good front. And good for washing things, like clothes, armor and money.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_71_01">Keep a low profile though. Never know who is looking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_73_01">Hit the Crime.net station to get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_73_03">The Crime.net station is your ticket to action. Go when you are ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_74_01">Someone should take out that trash.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_75_01">Alright, time to get to it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_77_01">If you want the information again, just play the pre-recorded message using the button.</string>
	 <string id="pln_sh_int_79_01">Get out to the alley.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_01_02">Looks like Charon freed himself! Now help him get out of here alive!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_01_03">Looks like he broke free and took a gun! You gotta help him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_02_01">Watch those windows, there might be snipers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_02_03">Stay sharp, guys, this whole place smells of sniper.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_03_01">Find the sniper and take him out before he takes the shot!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_03_02">Find that sniper and take him out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_04_01">Quickly guys, find him and take him out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_04_03">Get the sniper guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_04_04">Take the sniper out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_04_05">You gotta take the sniper out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_04_07">Take the sniper out, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_04_08">Guys! The sniper! Get him!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_05_02">Help Charon! Take &apos;em out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_05_07">Clear the street so Charon can move!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_05_08">Clear the street for Charon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_06_01">Watch out, they&apos;re deploying more snipers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_07_01">More snipers incoming!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_07_02">They&apos;re deploying another group of snipers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_07_05">They got more snipers incoming!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_07_06">Oh no - more snipers!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_08_02">It&apos;s the cops! Gang, deal with them! Protect Charon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_09_01">You really showed the NYPD how to dance. And I have a feeling they&apos;ll send more dancers.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_09_03">A rough day for the NYPD. And it&apos;ll get rougher - I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll send more reinforcements.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_10_01">More cops are arriving!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_10_04">Damn, there are more cops incoming!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_11_01">You heard him guys, get going!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_12_07">Move into the other building. You gotta rendezvous with Charon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_12_08">Charon is waiting for you, guys! Get moving!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_13_01">More snipers! Protect Charon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_14_02">That gate looks tough. See if you can find some thermite or something. You have to get that briefcase.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_15_02">That gate will melt like butter when you apply the thermite. Go get the briefcase!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_16_01">Get the briefcase! You&apos;ll need to drill the gate.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_16_02">Drill that gate! Get the briefcase!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_17_01">Great! Not gew the briefcase!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_17_02">Ok! Get the briefcase!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_17_03">Great job! Now get that briefcase!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_18_01">Get down that elevator shaft so you can meet up with Charon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_18_02">Go down the elevator shaft and meet up with Charon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_18_03">Charon is waiting down there! Get down the elevator shaft!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_19_02">Let&apos;s see... if you cross the street you should be able to get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_19_03">You should be able to find an escape route if you get out and cross the street.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_20_01">Twitch will be there with the van in about a minute. Hold on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_20_03">The van should be there in a minute. </string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_21_02">What&apos;s wrong, Charon? You ok?</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_22_01">You&apos;d better find some cover and make sure it&apos;s nothing bad.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_23_01">Move up to the windows so you get a view of the street!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_23_02">Move up to the windows, see what&apos;s going on!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_23_03">Move up to those windows so you get a good view of things!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_25_01">Guys! Don&apos;t forget Charon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_25_04">Make sure you get Charon out of here alive!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_25_09">Help Charon get to the escape van!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_26_03">There are more of them down in the street! Take &apos;em out!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_27_02">You&apos;ll need to break through those doors! Maybe there&apos;s a crowbar around here somewhere?</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_28_02">Don&apos;t forget to get the briefcase!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_28_04">Get that briefcase, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_28_06">You need to get that briefcase, remember!</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_brf_01">You&apos;re going to New York tonight. The Continental called - one of their key staff has been ambushed and is being held by unknown assailants at an address in Brooklyn. We have the location from a call he made just as they took him. The target&apos;s name is Charon. We need to get there fast, take out whoever&apos;s got him and send him back to the Continental safe and sound.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_cnc_02">The Continental in New York need you to rescue one of their own. They pay well.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_intro_01">Ok, let&apos;s find this guy. He should be around here somewhere.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_intro_02">Make sure you find the target quickly. You don&apos;t know what they&apos;ll do to him.</string>
	 <string id="pln_spa_intro_03">Ok, guys. Find the target and get him out of there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_01_03">Damn! Alright, I&apos;m sending the drill.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_02_03">Great! That&apos;s what we came for. Once the driver drops &apos;em off, he&apos;ll return for the ammo.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_03_02">Ammo secured, I&apos;m sending your pick-up ASAP. Be ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_04_01">Plug that hard-drive into one of the train vault security systems, I should be able to hack it open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_04_03">We can hack open a train vault if you plug that hard-drive into its security panel.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_05_01">Nice, I&apos;m in. Wow, pretty nifty security. Who are these guys, section 9?</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_06_02">One of their security buffers just kicked in. Disconnect it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_07_01">I&apos;m reconnected. Thanks.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_07_03">Alright, I&apos;m back in.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_cbf_01_01">The blueprint you found was for a new Type of Turret. It looks like the government is transporting it soon. If we act fast, we can catch them off guard and steal it without anyone noticing.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_cnc_01_01">The government owes us lunch money. Looks like we&apos;ll be taking their turret and a few bags of ammo as compensation.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1b_cnc_01_02">We got the train moving the prototype turret stopped at signals outside the city. Get there, get that turret.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_01_02">Those railcars are locked down. That card should help with that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_01_03">An access card. Great! That will help you get silent access to a railcar.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_02_01">We can sell those shells, if you can carry them out. But focus on the turret.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_03_02">Paydirt! That&apos;s what we came for, gang. The drill is on its way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_04_01">Great. Get it moving!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_06_01">Almost through the vault door. Get ready.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_06_02">The drill is almost done. Stand by, gang.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_08_01">That&apos;s live high explosive, so be gentle.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_08_03">Gently does it. Very gently.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_09_01">That&apos;s the alarm, guys. Expect a fast response!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_09_02">Damn, that&apos;s the alarm. Get ready for action!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_11_01">That&apos;s it. We got the turret. Im sending your pick-up ASAP.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_12_01">There it is. Break that down and get each piece out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_13_02">We&apos;re past the first lock. Now let&apos;s see what&apos;s inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_13_03">OK, we&apos;re into the railcar. Use the camera to see what&apos;s inside.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_14_02">Those shells have an angry temper. And a dollar value. Be careful with them.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_14_03">Be very careful with those bags, gang. They don&apos;t take the rough stuff well.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_15_01">OK, the chopper is almost there. Stand by.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_15_02">The chopper is in the area. Watch the skies.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_16_01">OK, the drill is on the ground. Get it and get those vaults open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_17_03">Nice. That&apos;s the keycard for the railcars. </string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_18_01">Keep your eyes open for a keycard. </string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_18_03">Shake those workers down. Maybe one of them has a keycard.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_21_01">You need to dismantle that turret.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_24_02">That&apos;s the pilot with the lance. Get it.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_25_02">The pilot just signaled that he&apos;s deploying the lance. He&apos;s done his job, now you do yours. </string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_26_01">OK, the pilot is on the way with another lance. You guys are greedy. I respect that.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_29_01">That&apos;s it! That&apos;s what we&apos;re looking for.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_29_03">One high-tech, high-value piece of military badass right there.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_30_02">We can&apos;t get the ammo out until all those turret pieces are in the vehicle. Stash the ammo for later. Focus on securing the turret.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_brf_01_01">That blueprint you found was for a new type of infantry turret - codenamed RC1. Real next-gen shit. Digging a little deeper, I got word of a specially chartered train, headed in to the Pentagon. I&apos;ve hacked the rail network, and they think they&apos;ve stopped due to a glitch in the switches. Three railcars. One has the hardware. The other two have its ammo. It all sells, but your priority is the turret. They won&apos;t be expecting you.</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_end_02_01">It was messy but you got the job done. Nice work!</string>
	 <string id="pln_tr1_intro_01_02">You need to get close and locate the right railcar. Once you&apos;ve ID&apos;d it, look around - you might be able to find an access card for the railcars.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_20_any_01">Move it, guys!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_20_any_02">Here we go!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_22_any_01">Guys, we&apos;re in the middle of the city - try to do this stealthy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_23_any_01">There&apos;s the call - cops are on their way!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_25_any_02">Stay frosty! Here they come!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_25_any_04">It&apos;s rock-the-clock!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_26_any_01">Heat is coming in. I&apos;m moving the escape car.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_27_any_03">We&apos;re moving the escape car. Hang on.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_27_any_04">We&apos;re moving the escape car. Don&apos;t blow the horn yet - this place is crawling with cops.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_28_any_01">Escape car is there. You need to be finished soon fellas. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_29_any_02">Escape is here, so whenever you&apos;re ready!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_30_any_01">The cops are all ready on the scene. They&apos;ve must have been close by.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_32_any_02">Get some more loot if you can!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_33_any_01">Has anyone found the tiara yet?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_33_any_03">Guys, if you haven&apos;t found the tiara yet - you better find it soon. We&apos;re running out of time!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_35_any_02">It might be in the front too. It doesn&apos;t have to be in the back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_36_any_04">Keep your crowd controlled!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_36_any_05">Keep it clean! Keep the civs out of the line of fire!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_37_any_02">You&apos;re still good. No one has heard you yet!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_37_any_03">Five by five, you&apos;re still OK.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_38_any_01">Someone saw the broken window!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_38_any_03">They saw the broken window!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_39_any_03">The alarm&apos;s been tripped!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_40_any_02">Girl in the window, get out of sight!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_42_any_01">That girl made you, here we go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_43_any_01">Aw, there&apos;s a metal detector, wasn&apos;t in the plan.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_43_any_03">They must have just installed that metal detector.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_44_any_02">Alright, keep going! It&apos;s got to be there!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_44_any_03">How can it be empty!? Aah!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_45_any_02">Cameras got us, time for plan B.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_46_any_01">Great work! Metal detector down.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_46_any_03">Metal detector seems to be down. Great work!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_48_any_02">What did I say about civilians?</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_49_any_02">Snipers deployed, keep your heads down!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_52_any_01">Awesome! That&apos;s extra cash for us, drinks are on me!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_52_any_04">Serious haul. You guys did well!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_53_any_01">No one even heard you. True pros!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_53_any_02">I knew you were pros and no one even heard you. Amazing!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_53_any_03">Cold and calculated, just like we want it!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_54_any_01">Great! You guys can escape now, but choose to go for more of the extra loot.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_54_any_02">Alright, the choice is: escape now - or - go for more loot, your call!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_55_any_01">There&apos;s movement in the alleys. Stay alert!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_55_any_02">Movement in the alleys. Stay sharp!</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_brief_01">Vlad really doesn&apos;t like this Dmitri guy. One of these old-country feuds, maybe he shagged his sister or something. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_brief_01b">Anyway let&apos;s help the man settle the score. We go for the tiara - back room from what I understand. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_end_a_02">Nice work. Vlad got what we came for. A little bonus jewelry would have been nice, I&apos;m not going to lie but there&apos;s always another day.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_end_a_03">Time to collect on that tiara. Vlad will be happy. You guys just crashed a wedding. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_end_b_01">Nice, jewels and tiara. Time to collect from Vlad. He&apos;s going to be happy. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_end_b_02">Nice run team. The tiara is secured and Vlad can&apos;t contain himself with joy. Let&apos;s go see the crazy Ruskie. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_end_b_03">What do they call that? Bling?  Anyway time for a payday.</string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_end_c_01">Now that&apos;s a knockover. Good job getting everything there, that was a lot of work. The tiara is a bonus in this case and Vlad is happy as hell. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_end_c_02">Drinks on me for this one... Super fine hit, people. </string>
	 <string id="pln_ukranian_stage1_intro_a_02">OK, this is business as usual for Vlad. We get the tiara, we get the jewels if you want them. You can do this job any way you want as long as you get the tiara. Back to the van when you are done. </string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_01_any_02">OK listen to me, when those doors open you better be ready to get out.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_02_any_01">Hey, there&apos;s so many cops out there! Get yourself ready to deal with them when the doors open.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_02_any_02">Hey, half the God damn police force is out there. Are you ready to defend yourselves!?</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_03_any_01">Hold them back, I&apos;m looking for an escape driver as we speak!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_03_any_03">Return fire! I&apos;m getting you a driver, you need to keep them off the coke!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_03_any_04">You return fire and keep them off your position! I&apos;ll get you a God damn driver! OK!?</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_05_any_02">You hear that everybody? You got three minutes until he gets here. Hold them back! </string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_06_any_02">Hey The pick-up car is coming here in two minutes so you just have to fight a little more!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_06_any_03">Hey, two minutes, we have two more minutes until the pick-up car! Not much longer!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_08_any_01">30 secs, get ready to move that coke!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_08_any_02">30 seconds till pick-up!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_08_any_03">You have 30 seconds!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_09_any_03">Watch for flanking!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_09_any_05">Hold &apos;em back!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_09_any_07">He&apos;ll be here soon!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_10_any_03">Alright, the pick-up driver is here! He&apos;s on the street behind you!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_11_any_03">OK everyone, the driver&apos;s here but he parked on the other side of the street! Cross over on that walkway.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_12_any_01">OK! Now get the bags into the truck. We need at least four bags.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_14_any_01">That&apos;s one in, great! We need at least three more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_14_any_02">One down! We need three more, at least three more.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_15_any_01">Beautiful! We just need two more - at least two more bags.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_15_any_02">Great! Now you need two more - at least two more bags to make Hector happy.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_15_any_03">OK, now you just need two more bags for Hector.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_16_any_01">OK folks, we just need one more bag for Hector and we&apos;re good to go.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_16_any_03">OK, gentlemen! Another bag and Hector&apos;s end is covered and we can get into the real moneymaking.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_17_any_03">That bag should put us in the black.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_17_any_04">Great, now we&apos;re making money here.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_18_any_03">Escape driver&apos;s comin in now. The escape driver is coming in now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_19_any_01">Close God damn call! Now head for the docks!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_22_any_01">Let me patch in the chopper pilot now!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_22_any_02">Patching the chopper pilot in!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_23_any_03">Chopper pilot&apos;s here! Move! Move! Move!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_24_any_01">Alright! The chopper&apos;s going to the docks, folks - out of the frying pan.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_end_a_01">I knew you&apos;d get out of that mess. You got all of it too. I let Hector&apos;s boat know. See you at the harbor!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage1_intro_a_02">Damn it! They&apos;re pulling their truck over. FBI. Don&apos;t let them take what&apos;s Hector&apos;s!</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_01_any_02">The boat&apos;s on the way for the pick-up. You need to get those bags secured now.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_02_any_02">Look, people! Get your shit together and get those bags secured before the cops do. The pick-up boat is on the way.</string>
	 <string id="pln_watchdogs_new_stage2_03_any_01">Alright, good! Now you need to signal the boat pick-up. Floodlights in the warehouse - look for a switch. </string>

	 <string id="rb5_hb2_12_01">A little hickup; there&apos;s a server missing in here. Log says it was taken to the IT Department for maintenance. We need that server, so you&apos;ll have to retrieve it.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_13_02">Interesting. Files on this server are pointin&apos; to some evidence being held by forensics. Let&apos;s check it out.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_13_03">Well, bugger me - files here are linking to some physical evidence down in the labs. Get down there, check it out!</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_14_01">OK, I&apos;ve copied all the information I found to this server. Grab the server and let&apos;s get out of here.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_14_02">Right. Fuck it. I gathered all the intel we need to one of the servers. Someone grab it and let&apos;s leg it.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_15_01">Come on, you wankers. Get that power up again.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_15_02">For fucks&apos; sake! Lads! The power!</string>

	 <string id="rb5_hb2_19_02">What&apos;s this? There&apos;s mention of a &quot;classified informant&quot; here, fucking knew it!</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_19_03">Let&apos;s see. There! &quot;Classified informant&quot;! I knew I smelled a rat.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_20_01">This isn&apos;t an average case. Lots of information restricted. I&apos;m not this important, am I?</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_21_02">They&apos;ve got everything. Every heist, every job. References to you guys too. But no names - guess the traitor is holding onto those.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_21_03">What the fuck. This file is huge. They know everything about me. And there are references to you too! No names - maybe the informant is holding out for a better price, the fuck.</string>
	 <string id="rb5_hb2_23_02">Gonna keep a low profile in here.</string>

	 <string id="vld_as1_08_13">How many skeletons will be getting thrown up with this earthquake.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_08_14">This West Coast crew specialises in shifting huge numbers of customisations, stored in safes. They made me their man on the East Coast. It&apos;s a big deal! My way in!</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_10_02">Few walls left standing after the earthquake...had to be these ones. Blow the fucking things.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_11_02">Ah, the first truck to be emptied. Beautiful sight. Safes aren&apos;t too heavy, are they?</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_12_01">How many safes is that? A quarter? Keep going.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_12_02">I know you&apos;re muscles are aching, but keep lifting those safes.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_13_01">That&apos;s half of the safes out of the trucks. Half way there!</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_13_03">Good, good.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_14_02">So close now. That looks like three-quarters of the safes out of the truck. Keep going! I believe in you!</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_15_01">Not going to risk driving them out. Got the pilot headed back, but he can&apos;t see you cos of all the dust and smoke. Light a flare for him!</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_15_02">The roads are too damned jammed with useless things like ambulances, and other shit like that. We&apos;re flying you out. Light a flare so the pilot can see you.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_15_03">Those safes are too precious to risk on these roads, so I&apos;m sending in a chopper. Thing is, pilot can&apos;t see a damn thing. You need to drop a flare for him.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_16_03">Get in the truck, all of you. There&apos;s cookies and candy inside, I promise.</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_17_01">I knew I could count on you, my friends! </string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_17_02">California dreaming, my friends! Dreaming of money, and loot, and guns, and....it&apos;s a great day!</string>
	 <string id="vld_as1_17_03">Even Mother Nature couldn&apos;t stop Vlad Or the Payday Gang! </string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_01_01">You need to tell them that shit? What are they, you treat them like babies?</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_01_02">When you&apos;re finished, bring back some tortillas and we&apos;ll have a barbecue or something. Vlad will make the Sputniks!</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_04_01">You think they have lots of goats in Mexico?</string>

	 <string id="vld_bex_16_02">It&apos;s... Is old family things. Don&apos;t you pay attention to it...</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_16_02a">My brother-in-law. You remember him, yes? He came down from a party in Chihuahua to help!</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_16_02b">You remember my Brother-in-law? Well, he&apos;s coming down from Chihuahua to give you a hand.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_20_01c">Hey guys, you better tell my brother-in-law to step on it!</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_24_02">I still think he will do better with a hit in the head.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_26_01">That&apos;s one big...drill.</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_29_01">Just start shooting, that gets people moving!</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_intro_02_01">Hey! Heey! Hey Hey Heeey! Locky!</string>
	 <string id="vld_bex_intro_02_02">Hey, Vlad is from Ukraine, not Russia!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_01_01">Ho ho ho, bitches!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_02_02">All right, drop those thugs before they can steal Christmas. Then into the workshop.</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_03_03">Now, search the toyshop for the elves. Convince them they&apos;re making toys for me now. And when I say toys, I mean fuckloads of coke!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_04_03">Damn cops. They&apos;re the ghost of Christmas fuck! Deal with them! Protect the elves! At all costs, protect the elves!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_05_01">Nice! Now, where do presents go? Into the chimney!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_05_02">Now, you know how Santa delivers presents, yes? Into the chimney with those packages.</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_05_03">Wonderful. Like winter wonderland, yes? Yes! Now, please let&apos;s get those bags of coke into the chimney. </string>
	 <string id="vld_can_06_02">Another white christmas for Vlad!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_06_05">You&apos;ve made Vlad happy. Here, have this!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_06_06">You&apos;ve been good little heisters. Here, have a gift.</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_07_02">The elves are slowing down. Go and tell them about the dental plan we offer. Work harder, or get your fucking teeth smashed in!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_07_03">Tell the elves to work harder, or the only thing they&apos;ll get in their stocking is my fist in their ass!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_07_04">Is that an elf slacking off there? Go tell him the only union law here is the union of my flamethrower with their chestnuts!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_07_06">Are those elves working as hard as they can? Perhaps you can &quot;motivate&quot; them?</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_07_07">If those pointy eared bastards want to see New Years Day, they better work harder. Tell them that!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_07_08">Remind those elves what Christmas is really about. The production of narcotics at the point of a gun!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_08_01">They&apos;re dead. All of them. Every elf. Dead. What the hell kind of Christmas story is this?</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_08_03">It is a sad day in Toytown. All of the elves are dead. Doesn&apos;t that just suck a reindeer&apos;s dick. </string>
	 <string id="vld_can_09_02">That&apos;s enough to keep Christmas cheery. But, you know, you want to keep those elves churning out goodies, I can always spread a little more cheer, you understand? Or you can leave. Up to you.</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_09_03">Well, you can escape, sure, that&apos;s fine. Or.......here&apos;s an idea. You can stay, bully more elves and make more beautiful snow!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_10_01">Okay, the last elf fell off the shelf, yes. Fuck him. Time to leave and enjoy your Christmas bonus, friends!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_10_02">Ahhh, there&apos;s the last elf dead. Am I sad? No, fuck that elf. We got the toys, so it&apos;s time to leave.</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_11_01">It&apos;s a Christmas miracle! Well done, my friends. May there be peace on Earth...until next year.</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_11_02">Excellent! Well done. DC will party tonight!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_12_01">Here, take this gift from my cousin. He said it should keep you warm!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_12_02">I might be in the business of taking, but don&apos;t say Vlad never gives back! It&apos;s christmas for fuck sake!</string>
	 <string id="vld_can_12_03">Throw this in a doorway, it should help keeps those naughty children away from the presents they don&apos;t deserve! </string>
	 <string id="vld_can_cnc_03">My little toymakers are having problems, my dear friends. Can you help?</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_01_02">There&apos;s that... Aargh, he&apos;s as much use as tits on teapot. Get up. Get up, suka blyad! On your feet!</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_01_03">Look at that drunken fuck. Face you want to shit on. Useless blyad..!</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_02_01">Stop acting, you big baby. I&apos;ll jam that bottle up your ass and pin it to your fucking prostate.</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_02_02">Wake up, old man. Fucking disgrace. I saw pilots do the Donetsk Run with four times as much booze!</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_03_02">He&apos;s on his way to me. Good work. You know, since you&apos;re there, if you could maybe find a few of my packages...</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_03_03">He&apos;s safe. Well, for now. Hey, since you&apos;re there, if you could perhaps collect a few of those presents... I&apos;d pay well.</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_05_03">I think I just heard another package. It&apos;s mine! Look for it!</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_05_04">Packages are still falling from the trees. Go! Go find them!</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_05_05">Christmas presents are still falling out of the sky! Pick up as many as you can!</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_06_01">Oh, this is embarrassing. Maybe you could... Nah, wife would never forgive me.</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_06_02">He spends more time in the dirt than his momma. That nickel whore!</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_06_03">Can you believe this tragic sack of crap was a hero? On your feet!</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_end_01">I won&apos;t lie. Part of me was hoping that mudak was dead. But that would be too much of a Christmas miracle, eh? You did good. Have some cash.</string>
	 <string id="vld_cp1_end_03">That was good work. And good... Sasha! Take those keys off him! Yes, good work. You deserve the bonus.</string>
	 <string id="vld_dn1_01_02">Clowns! Vlad here. What the hell are you doing in that - nevermind. There&apos;s a pig marked with an X in there. The Fed&apos;s will notice it when forensics come in. Get it out of there for me.</string>
	 <string id="vld_dn1_01_03">This is Vlad. What are you fuckers doing in that slaughterhouse? Nevermind, I don&apos;t care. What I do care about is a special pig there - marked with an X. It&apos;s really important that the Fed&apos;s don&apos;t sniff around it. Get it out of there, and I will love you forever.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_07a_01">Buluc likes to play bad hombre, but in truth he is a snake and a coward.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_07a_02">Buluc thinks he&apos;s a big showman, but is more of a slippery snake.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_13b_01">One of Buluc&apos;s bodyguards is called Mucho Mike. You believe that shit?</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_19a_01">This guy is fucking obsessed with this shit. He believes that if you don&apos;t take care of this shrine thing a demon will come at night and take your soul.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_19a_02">Every time we tried to do business, Buluc talked about this crazy Mayan cult he belongs to and sacrificing his soul. Vlad&apos;s only religions are money, women and drinking Sputniks!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_39a_02">Maybe you should just burn the place down instead? No, he would just get away, the little rat.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_43a_02">Too late now of course, but it would have been fun to see Buluc&apos;s head explode like in that movie... Jammer.. Spammers... whatever it&apos;s called.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_54b_01">Oh, use that thing on Buluc&apos;s leg! Cut it right off.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_57a_02">Now this piece of shit gets what Vlad wants him to have!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_57b_02">Take that, you fucker!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_57c_04">You have to wonder what a man thinks about when his genitals are being swallowed by a fish.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_57c_06">The shark went fishing for filthy Coyopa!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_57_03">Shoot him! Shoot him in the knee! Nononono, in the stomach! Then make him go over. </string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_57_05">This suspense is killing Vlad! Do it, do it!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_58a_01">Hey, before you go... break open that fuckers safe. Lots of things in there! Contacts, money... contracts. Very useful!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_58a_02">Vlad just remembered! Buluc keeps all his contacts and business information in a safe. Break into it and clean it out!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_59a_01">Holy shit. They look pissed. No more drug money for the Tijuana federales, yes?</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_59a_02">I would not expect the Federales to be so angry about one cartel boss. He must have paid them a LOT of money!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_01_01a">Vlad is very happy you&apos;re going to help him with this shit.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_01_02">Good, good. But you really have to get some better equipment! This stuff is old, low resolution. I can&apos;t see shit!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_01_02a">Vlad wants to see the fear in the eyes of that fucker Buluc when he is taken down, yes?$NL;</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_01_03">You do that, maybe I know some people. Hook you up!$NL;</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_02_02">They have all those bunkers and shit.$NL;</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_02_03">What sense? ha? What fucking sense? You don&apos;t get the joke? OK, I&apos;ll tell you.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_intro_04_03">Ok, ok... you just remember what I told you. Shit can come back to stalk you.$NL;</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap02_01">Hey guys... listen to this.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap02_01a">Wait, I just had an idea. Let&apos;s have some fun.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap02_01b">Sure we do! Listen...</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap02_02">Buluc, my old friend! How are you?</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap02_03a">Hey, can&apos;t I just call and say how much I love you?</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap03_02a">My wife&apos;s brother. That shit you did to him.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap03_03">Hey, fuck you.. you piece of shit.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap04_02">Helloooo my old friend!</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap05_01">Oh, that piece of shit is going to wish he had not fucked with Vlad.</string>
	 <string id="vld_fex_tap05_03">Such a waste, all this space, for that Mexican shit and his Coyopas...</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_01_01">What&apos;s taking you clowns so long? Check the Murkywater containers for the vault.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_03_01">Ah, don&apos;t wet your knickers, Bain! I have buyer. Very far away. Is all good. </string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_03_02">Keep calm, you big baby. Buyer very far away. Probably won&apos;t even use.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_04_01">I got a train ready. Not too far away. Bring the warheads. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_04_03">I have a train waiting for them. It&apos;s close by. Bring the nukes. Hurry!</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_05_01">Feeling okay? Any rectal bleeding? Check poop holes.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_05_07">Hope you&apos;re not getting sick. Nasty cold going around. Yeah, you probably just have cold.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_06_02">Is that Gaddafi&apos;s vintage 1965 Longfellow? Can you think of a more perfect way to bring the nukes to me?</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_07_01">You see that muscle car? That&apos;s Gaddafi&apos;s 1965 original. It&apos;s your ride now.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_07_02">Is that Gaddafi&apos;s vintage 1965 muscle car? Can you think of a more perfect way to bring the nukes to me?</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_08_02">That&apos;s the first.  Ah, such a small thing, but enough to wipe out Washington.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_09_01">Be careful with them. No intention to turn Washington into molten glass. Not today.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_cbf_01_01">I heard about the outstanding job you did sneaking into that Murkywater warehouse. Most impressive. I need you to go back there. Those mercenaries&apos;ve got a &apos;little something&apos; tucked away. A little something I would like. The Murkies are pulling out, and I need this before it disappears down some rabbit-hole.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_cnc_01_01">My dear friends. Just a quick pick-up job. Fetch me a &apos;little something&apos; from the Murkywater warehouse.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_cnc_01_02">There&apos;s a &apos;little something&apos; I need you to fetch me from the Murkywater warehouse. Quick smash and grab.</string>
	 <string id="vld_ko1b_end_01_02">Outstanding! Glad you got out of that one without setting the Eastern Seaboard on fire.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_01_01">My friends, you will save my Christmas.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_01_03">Go find Santa, my little helpers. We can still have a white Christmas.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_03_01">Please free my brother-in-law. He&apos;s an idiot, but he&apos;s family.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_03_02">I hope my brother-in-law remembers where he put the cocaine.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_04_03">I bet you&apos;ve always wanted to punch that judgemental bastard Santa Claus! Now is your chance!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_04_04">Smack that idiot from me!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_04_05">Give him a good punch! Wake him up, teach him a lesson!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_05_01">Jewelry store! My favorite place!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_05_03">Stones and coke. Beautiful!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_09_02">Keypads, electronic magic. Ah you can do it!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_09_03">The display is locked! See how tighly these assholes guard their treasures! Like dragon in stories!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_10_01">Perfect! Now get the Jewelry box!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_13_01">What the fuck. Cocaine in toys? It&apos;s brilliant! I have to remember this.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_14_01">What! Some shopper asshole is walking around with my cocaine! Find it!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_14_02">What? No! They sold all the Tin Boys!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_15_01">Hey Tin Boy! You got a drug problem!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_15_02">Tin Boy is all coked up!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_16_01">Fuck the other toys - get Tin Boy!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_16_02">Get that Tin Boy with my cocaine!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_16_03">Tin Boy - where aaare you?</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_17_01">10? That&apos;s my size! And I don&apos;t mean shoes...</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_17_02">Get those fucking shoes!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_17_03">What an idiot! Find the shoes!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_18_01">How hard can it be to find a fucking shoe box?</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_18_03">Come on, compute with the computer!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_19_01">Alright, it should be in the storage. Drill the fucking door.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_19_02">Drill that door open, find the shoes, get my cocaine!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_20_01">Get those fucking shoes!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_21_03">So where are they?!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_22_01">I can&apos;t believe this place is so messy.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_22_02">What&apos;s in these boxes?</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_22_03">Fucking boxes everywhere. It&apos;s like that video game...</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_23_01">VR? What the fuck is that?</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_23_02">VR. Very... enhanced... reality. What bullshit.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_23_03">Cocaine and VR - what an interesting mix.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_24_03">VR - Vlad&apos;s Rejoicing. That&apos;s what this means to me.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_25_01">Ah a safe! How interesting!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_25_02">I&apos;m sure a tiny little safe is not a problem for you.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_26_02">Come on, what are you waiting for?</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_26_03">Get the stuff, my friends!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_27_01">I love a good wine with my borscht! Tasty!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_27_02">Get the wine! But don&apos;t start drinking  - it&apos;s enough with one drunk Santa!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_27_03">Wine and cocaine! We could just sell it as a party pack!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_28_01">Get that Red Red Resurrection or whatever it was called!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_28_02">Maybe I should start importing wine too! Vlad&apos;s Wines! I like the sound of it.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_28_03">Wine, women and song! And cocaine! Merry Christmas!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_29_01">Our friend Bile will soon be around for the afterparty. Make sure you welcome him.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_29_03">Rescue from above is coming soon, my friends!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_30_03">I want a beautiful Christmas tree with presents in it!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_31_02">I want the tree. It shall fly into the sky like a big Christmas rocket! Hahaha!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_31_03">That tree is very nice. We will steal it.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_32_01">Ladies and gentlemen, can you place some explosives please?</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_32_03">I think it would be nice to blow the roof off this mall!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_33_03">It&apos;s a nice tree, and we will take it. Don&apos;t damage it!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_34_01">This tree is leaving. So is Santa!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_34_02">Let&apos;s make like a tree and leave, my friends!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_35_02">Maybe he&apos;ll get lost walking those 2 meters to the tree.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_36_01">Bile will be back soon. Hold on my friends!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_36_02">Maybe do some shopping while you wait?</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_36_03">Just wait there, you&apos;ll be picked up soon. I promise!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_38_02">One of my best Christmases was that one time when I killed a dirty snitch on Christmas morning. Tied him to a Christmas tree in front of his family and set him on fire. It was beautiful.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_38_04">I hope these fucking cops go home and reconsider their actions. They didn&apos;t treat Santa very well, so there will be no presents this year.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_38_05">I always do good business around Christmas. People spend a lot of money. It&apos;s the stress, they need my stuff.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_38_06">They say you should work with family because you can trust them. But this guy, I can only trust him to be an idiot and to fuck up.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_38_07">My wife said she might go shopping here tomorrow. I should warn her that it&apos;ll probably be closed. (laughs)</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_38_08">There is something about the sound of shattering shop windows that I find very pleasing. I don&apos;t know why.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_38_09">They say always treat others like they treat you. And I&apos;ve been treated very badly, many times.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_39_03">That&apos;s a beautiful tree! Stop it, you barbarians!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_39_04">You can destroy anything you want, and kill anyone you want, but leave the tree alone!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_39_05">Don&apos;t shoot the tree! You&apos;ll ruin Christmas!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_39_06">Hey, I have plans for that tree! Don&apos;t destroy it!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_39_08">Don&apos;t shoot the tree! It&apos;s an endangered species!</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_intro_01">They say having family is beautiful but sometimes I don&apos;t know. Now find that stupid fuck and free him - hopefully he&apos;s not too drunk to remember in which boxes he hid the cocaine.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_intro_02">I wish I didn&apos;t have these kinds of problems. It&apos;s so hard to find good help these days.</string>
	 <string id="vld_moon_intro_03">I&apos;ll start calling him Rudolph, that red-nosed drunk fuck! Find him, and find my coke!</string>
	 <string id="vld_nightclub_brf_speak_01">This Tasteful Club was mine. After prison... No longer so. I know the owner and his ways. He&apos;s a useless (prick).</string>
	 <string id="vld_nightclub_brf_speak_03">His club will be full of people - get past them to his safe. He should keep that close to himself. If he dies he dies! If he lives - he is lucky shit.</string>
	 <string id="vld_nightclub_brf_speak_04">His party is over - I want all his money for his treason. You go in and you take all from him. Find the safe and fast.</string>
	 <string id="vld_nightclub_brf_speak_04b">This is in a neighbourhood with police. They don&apos;t like party crashing. </string>
	 <string id="vld_nightclub_cnc_01">My old club needs visit. I know owner - he keeps money in safe somewhere. By now much money. Too much, is what I say.</string>
	 <string id="vld_nightclub_cnc_03">We are going to party. Party all my former money from my (asshole) competitor. You will help?</string>
	 <string id="vld_nightclub_debrief_01">Very good party you had! Thank you! This will make others think twice next time.</string>
	 <string id="vld_nightclub_debrief_02">You party hard, hahaha! Like night in St. Petersburg. I have now more power and more hunger. We will take this town again.</string>
	 <string id="vld_nightclub_debrief_03">Hehe, ho-wow! You party like a real Russian. Mhm! Haha. Now spend money and come back to me when ready to take on bigger things. Yeah... Vlad is growing.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_01_02">Listen out for the goats. They&apos;ll be making...goat noises.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_02_01">Just....goat &quot;noises&quot;! Screaming. Well, wouldn&apos;t you with 5lbs of coke up your ass?</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_02_02">I ain&apos;t Sir David Attenborough! Or Igor the Croat. Just....goat noises!</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_02_03">Whatever noise you expect from a farm animal with a bag of coke buried in it&apos;s shitpipe.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_04_02">A goat got into an apartment up there. Get after it! Look for a way in.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_01">Yes! Get in there, you hairy little bastard!</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_03">And don&apos;t fucking move. Fucking goat prick...</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_12">Another goat secured.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_14">Don&apos;t move. Or I&apos;ll slow-fucking-roast you.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_15">You move, and you&apos;ll be in Igors bed before you can say &quot;oh shit&quot;.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_16">No more runny-run for you, goat-boy.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_17">Get in there, ya ugly little fuck!</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_18">No more adventures for you, little friend.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_05_20">Yes! Good! Goats!!</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_06_01">A real bargain, yes?</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_06_02">Found the tricksy little shit!</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_07_01">Nice. Good! Now, Boris is going to lead you to a farm outside the city. There he can...extract the coke. </string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_07_03">Nice job, friends, but you&apos;re only halfway there. Follow Boris. He&apos;ll lead you to a farm outside the city, where he can..you know...extract the coke. Protect him.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_cnc_01">I need you to break up a smuggling operation. Get the coke. There&apos;s just one small complication....</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_cnc_03">A Honduran cartel are trying to set up in DC. Using mules. Except not mules. You&apos;ll see....</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt1_intro_02">Ah, my friends. So, the &quot;mules&quot;, you see...well, they&apos;re actually goats. And they&apos;ve..errr, escaped. Find them for me.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt2_01_01">Fortunately, you have the criminal mind of Vlad on your side. I have an idea.</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt2_01_03">Stay cool, my friends. Vlad has an idea. You like Vlad&apos;s ideas, yeah?</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt2_02_03">My brother-in-law is on his way. He will drop a skyhook cage for you. </string>
	 <string id="vld_pt2_03_03">Wait, some of the goats are missing. Why are some of the goats missing?!</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt2_04_01">That&apos;s it! We got the goats, we got the coke! Ka-ching-fucking-ching, my friends! Now, who wants to come over for a curry?</string>
	 <string id="vld_pt2_04_02">Well done, dear friends. I fucking love you all. Not as much as I love all of this coke, but still quite a lot!</string>
	 <string id="wlf_pal_intro_01">Bodhi&apos;s Pool Repair.</string>
	 <string id="wlf_pal_intro_02">Sorry to hear that, sir! We&apos;ll send our guys over right away!</string>
