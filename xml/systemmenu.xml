	 <string id="sm_52_desc">Dear friends, the Dentist and those Murky keks have infected Bain with a strange virus while they had him. I managed to pull some information from the Murky mainframe and recognize the codename. The virus is a refined strain of something they got hold of many years ago, when they were contracted by the US government to develop biological toxins using loopholes in existing bio-warfare treaties. I had an old bio-med contact look at it and, while the virus isn&apos;t contagious, the situation is blerrie awful. There is no cure. Bain only has, at most, a few days until he is consumed from within. I asked Chains once when Bain&apos;s obsession with this whole secret dinges started, and he told me about the Cagliostro manuscript being payment for a hospital job many years ago, involving the blood of a patient in isolation. I remember an incident back at Murky around the same time, with a huge scandal and coverup. One of the... volunteers... Murky was doing medical tests on had gotten out and needed to be contained. It can&apos;t be a coincidence. Maybe Bain&apos;s search, will ultimately be his end.</string>

I had a friend help me hack into the security feed and we&apos;ve managed to find out that they are in fact holding two almost identical cases.

He&apos;s tipped us off about an auction taking place in Salem, Massachusetts where they&apos;re offering items from a shipwreck recently discovered in Antarctica. According to the notes and research left by Duke&apos;s grandfather, one of the passengers was somehow involved with the Kataru. This passenger was apparently traveling to an unknown location and hoped to divert the course of the ship when it disappeared in 1905. Something he carried with him is apparently important, and you know... an auction with lots of nice, juicy antiques might just boost our coffers a bit, yeah?</string>

	 <string id="sm_51_desc">OK, here we go. Those Kataru dwankies have had their nasty paws on our Bain for far too long. With information provided by the Elephant, I have managed to find where Bain is being kept. Murkywater has many facilities and this is one of the worst- a run-down prison they bought from the US military in the 70s, located on a small island with a lighthouse. No one pays attention to the place as long as the lighthouse works, because the Murkys are running it through a utilities subsidiary. The prison was originally used to hold Japanese POWs after Pearl Harbor and has been equipped with advanced medical facilities. When I was with Murky, rumor was they did some very nasty experiments there. I&apos;m working on a plan to get you in there and extract Bain. Let&apos;s hope we&apos;re not too late.</string>

He was always talking about pulling off the &apos;greatest heist&apos; or whatever... and I never really did know what he meant, until now. It&apos;s like this- at the end of the American civil war, President Lincoln issued pardons to Confederate soldiers, to help unite the country. To make them easier to distribute, many of the documents were left without assignees, and were delivered by his generals. As it happens, some of these pardons still exist, locked away... in the blerrie White House. And listen to this, friends- they are still legal! Imagine getting away with all we&apos;ve done and retiring... that would indeed be something mighty, yeah? Well, you chops, we&apos;re going for it. Now that the building it has been nicely emptied by the dwankies causing all the world-upending ruckus, we can probably get inside. They only seem to have a skeleton crew of Murkys guarding it- no doubt maneuvered in place by the Dentist after the Secret Service and other agencies were relocated. But it&apos;s not going to be easy... and it will be an all-or-nothing job. If we fail, it&apos;s over. For real, this time.</string>
